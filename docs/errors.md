# Error Handling

## AssistantMessage Errors

`AssistantMessage` includes an `error` field for API-level errors:

```ruby
ClaudeAgentSDK.query(prompt: "Hello") do |message|
  if message.is_a?(ClaudeAgentSDK::AssistantMessage) && message.error
    case message.error
    when 'rate_limit'            then puts "Rate limited - retry after delay"
    when 'authentication_failed' then puts "Check your API key"
    when 'billing_error'         then puts "Check your billing status"
    when 'invalid_request'       then puts "Invalid request format"
    when 'server_error'          then puts "Server error - retry later"
    end
  end
end
```

See [examples/error_handling_example.rb](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/blob/main/examples/error_handling_example.rb).

## Exception Handling

```ruby
require 'claude_agent_sdk'

begin
  ClaudeAgentSDK.query(prompt: "Hello") { |message| puts message }
rescue ClaudeAgentSDK::ControlRequestTimeoutError
  puts "Control protocol timed out — consider increasing the timeout"
rescue ClaudeAgentSDK::CLINotFoundError
  puts "Please install Claude Code"
rescue ClaudeAgentSDK::ResultError => e
  # More specific than ProcessError — must be rescued first.
  case e.terminal_reason
  when 'api_error' then puts "API failed (HTTP #{e.api_error_status}): #{e.result}"
  else puts "Run failed (#{e.subtype}): #{e.errors.join('; ')}"
  end
rescue ClaudeAgentSDK::ProcessError => e
  puts "Process failed with exit code: #{e.exit_code}"
rescue ClaudeAgentSDK::CLIJSONDecodeError => e
  puts "Failed to parse response: #{e}"
end
```

An ordinary exception raised inside your own callbacks (hooks, `can_use_tool`,
SDK MCP tool handlers, resource readers and prompt generators) is not raised
to the code above. It is reported to the CLI as a failed callback, and the
session keeps running. `exit`, `Interrupt` and other signal exceptions are the
exception: the CLI gets the error response first, and then they propagate as
Ruby normally would. See
[Hooks & Permission Callbacks](hooks-and-permissions.md#when-a-callback-raises)
and [MCP Servers](mcp-servers.md).

## Terminal Error Results

When a run fails, the CLI emits a `result` message with `is_error: true` (which
you still receive as a `ResultMessage`) and *then* exits non-zero on purpose,
for shell-script consumers. That trailing process failure carries nothing
beyond "exit code 1", so the SDK replaces it with a `ResultError` carrying the
payload the CLI already reported — you can branch on *why* the run failed
without matching on strings:

```ruby
begin
  ClaudeAgentSDK.query(prompt: "...") { |m| handle(m) }
rescue ClaudeAgentSDK::ResultError => e
  retry_later    if e.terminal_reason == 'api_error'   # overloaded / timeout
  widen_budget   if e.subtype == 'error_max_turns'
  raise
end
```

`ResultError` subclasses `ProcessError`, so existing `rescue ProcessError`
handlers keep working unchanged — but rescue `ResultError` **first** if you
want the structured fields.

The exception message prefers, in order: the CLI's `errors[]`, then `result`,
then a non-`success` `subtype`, then the HTTP status. A run that ends on an API
failure arrives as `subtype: "success"` with `is_error: true` and the prose in
`result`, which is why `subtype` alone is not used as the message.

A refused resume (a nonexistent session, or a `resume_drops_turn` guard
failure) reaches you the same way — including on a control request such as the
initial handshake that was still in flight when the CLI exited. Match on
`Resume rejected by --resume-drops-turn:` in the message and treat it as
deterministic: clear the fork target and resume plainly rather than retrying.

## Authentication Failures

The SDK holds no credentials; the CLI authenticates itself (see the README's
[Authentication](../README.md#authentication)). Neither of the two ways that
can fail is reported when the session starts.

**No credentials at all** (a fresh container, a CI runner). The first prompt
comes back as an `AssistantMessage` whose `error` is `'authentication_failed'`
(its text is "Not logged in · Please run /login", a command an SDK host cannot
run), followed by a `ResultMessage` with `is_error` set. `query()` and `ask`
then raise `ResultError` with `terminal_reason == 'api_error'`. A `Client`
session stays open, so check the result's `is_error` there.

**A key or token the API rejects.** It ends the same way, with
`api_error_status` 401, but only after the CLI has retried: ten
`APIRetryMessage`s over about three minutes when tested. Watch for them rather
than waiting for the error:

```ruby
ClaudeAgentSDK.query(prompt: "Hello") do |message|
  next unless message.is_a?(ClaudeAgentSDK::APIRetryMessage)

  warn "API retry #{message.attempt}/#{message.max_retries}: HTTP #{message.error_status} (#{message.error})"
end
```

## Errors from Client Control Methods

`Client#interrupt`, `#set_model`, `#set_permission_mode`, `#rewind_files`, `#reconnect_mcp_server`, `#toggle_mcp_server`, `#stop_task` and the other control methods (the Ruby-style `model=` and `permission_mode=` included) send a request to the CLI and wait for its answer. They can fail in three ways:

| What happened | Raised |
|---------------|--------|
| The client is not connected, or the connection ended while the request was waiting | `CLIConnectionError` |
| The CLI did not answer in time | `ControlRequestTimeoutError` |
| The CLI answered with an error: an MCP server name it does not know, a rewind without `enable_file_checkpointing`, a permission mode it does not accept | a plain `StandardError` whose message is the CLI's text |

The third is **not** a `ClaudeSDKError`, so `rescue ClaudeAgentSDK::ClaudeSDKError` does not catch it:

```ruby
begin
  client.reconnect_mcp_server('my-server')
rescue ClaudeAgentSDK::ClaudeSDKError => e
  puts "Connection lost or timed out: #{e.message}"
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "The CLI refused: #{e.message}" # e.g. "Server not found: my-server"
end
```

Rescue `StandardError` for it, and do not test for the exact class.

## Configuring Timeout

The control request timeout defaults to **1200 seconds** (20 minutes) to accommodate long-running agent sessions. Override it via environment variable:

```bash
export CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_CONTROL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300  # 5 minutes
```

## Error Type Reference

```ruby
# Base class of the SDK's error classes (all the ones below)
class ClaudeSDKError < StandardError; end

# Raised when connection to Claude Code fails
class CLIConnectionError < ClaudeSDKError; end

# Raised when the control protocol does not respond in time
class ControlRequestTimeoutError < CLIConnectionError; end

# Raised when Claude Code CLI is not found
class CLINotFoundError < CLIConnectionError
  # @param message [String] Error message (default: "Claude Code not found")
  # @param cli_path [String, nil] Optional path to the CLI that was not found
end

# Raised by CLIInstaller.install / .install_pinned (and the
# claude_agent_sdk:install_cli rake task) when the CLI cannot be installed.
# Never raised by query, ask or Client
class CLIInstallError < ClaudeSDKError; end

# Raised by the local-disk session APIs when CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is unset and
# no usable home directory exists for the default ~/.claude
class ConfigDirError < ClaudeSDKError; end

# Raised when resuming from a SessionStore fails: a store call raised or
# exceeded load_timeout_ms during resume materialization. #cause holds the
# adapter's exception (or the timeout)
class SessionStoreError < ClaudeSDKError; end

# Raised when the Claude Code process fails
class ProcessError < ClaudeSDKError
  attr_reader :exit_code,  # Integer | nil
              :stderr      # String | nil
end

# Raised when the CLI exits after reporting a terminal error result.
# Subclasses ProcessError, so existing `rescue ProcessError` keeps working.
class ResultError < ProcessError
  attr_reader :subtype,          # String | nil ('error_max_turns', 'error_during_execution', ...)
              :errors,           # Array<String> - error strings from the CLI (may be empty)
              :result,           # String | nil - result text; holds the "API Error: ..." prose
              :api_error_status, # Integer | nil - HTTP status of the failing API call
              :terminal_reason,  # String | nil - why the run ended ('api_error', 'max_turns', ...)
              :session_id,       # String | nil
              :data,             # Hash - raw `result` payload as emitted by the CLI
              :original_error    # ProcessError | nil - the bare exit error this replaced
end

# Raised when JSON parsing fails
class CLIJSONDecodeError < ClaudeSDKError
  attr_reader :line,           # String - The line that failed to parse
              :original_error  # Exception - The original JSON decode exception
end

# Raised when message parsing fails
class MessageParseError < ClaudeSDKError
  attr_reader :data  # Hash | nil
end
```

| Error | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ClaudeSDKError` | Base class of every error class in this table. One failure is not a `ClaudeSDKError`: a control request the CLI rejects, see [Errors from Client Control Methods](#errors-from-client-control-methods) |
| `CLIConnectionError` | Connection issues — including every write after a stdin write was cancelled mid-frame (the connection is unusable from then on — reconnect), and `ClaudeAgentSDK.ask` when the stream ends without a `ResultMessage` |
| `ControlRequestTimeoutError` | Control protocol timeout (configurable via env var) |
| `CLINotFoundError` | Claude Code not installed |
| `CLIInstallError` | `CLIInstaller.install` / `install_pinned` (or the `claude_agent_sdk:install_cli` rake task) could not install the CLI: unsupported platform, invalid version, HTTP error, a response or download over its size limit, checksum mismatch, or a filesystem error. A wrapped failure keeps the original exception in `#cause`. This is the error a deploy or `bin/setup` script rescues; a failed install leaves a previously installed binary in place. See [CLI installer](cli-installer.md) |
| `ConfigDirError` | A local-disk session API (`list_sessions`, `get_session_*`, `rename_session`, ...) could not locate the Claude config directory: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is unset and there is no usable home directory (`HOME` unset with no passwd entry, as under `docker --user` in a minimal image, or an empty/relative `HOME`). Set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| `SessionStoreError` | Resuming from `session_store:` failed: a store call (`#load`, `#list_sessions`, `#list_subkeys`) raised or exceeded `load_timeout_ms` while the SDK materialized the transcript, before the CLI started. The message names the call; `#cause` is the adapter's exception. Before 1.0 this was a bare `RuntimeError` — see [Sessions](sessions.md#mirroring-to-a-sessionstore) |
| `ProcessError` | Process failed (includes `exit_code` and `stderr`) — also raised when the CLI is still running 5s after closing stdout and the SDK had to terminate it |
| `ResultError` | Run ended on a terminal error result (subclasses `ProcessError`; adds `subtype`, `errors`, `api_error_status`, `terminal_reason`, ...) — rescue it first |
| `CLIJSONDecodeError` | JSON parsing issues — including stdout ending mid-frame (a truncated final message; `line` holds the partial frame) |
| `MessageParseError` | Message parsing issues |
