# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Syncs with Python SDK 0.2.174 (previously 0.2.162). Python #1331 and #1332 were already in 1.2.0, and `SandboxSettings#ignore_violations` already took the command-pattern Hash that Python #1380 fixed its type to; every other release in the range only bumps the CLI Python bundles.

### Fixed
- **`get_session_messages` and `get_subagent_messages` (disk and `session_store:`) no longer drop the tool calls of a parallel batch** (Python SDK #1422). The conversation goes on from the tool result written last. When that result answers an earlier call of the batch than the last one, the `tool_use` entries written after that call were off the path the readers walk, so 1.2.0's fix (#157) never saw them: the readers returned neither those calls nor their results. Of the parallel batches in one developer's local transcripts, about 7% have this shape. The readers now put back every entry of an API message on the conversation, right after its last entry there (in timestamp order), then the results as before. A result that the CLI parented on a hook attachment instead of its call's entry (its `sourceToolAssistantUUID` still names the call) is put back as well, when the same agent wrote both. The guards from #157 hold: the chain's own result wins, at most one result comes back per call, and the result of a branch a rewind dropped stays out. A later call of the batch going on from an earlier result does not count as a branch that went on. Affected sessions return more messages than before, so `offset:`/`limit:` pages over them shift. Python fixes the main-session readers only; here both readers are fixed.

### Changed
- `docs/options.md`: `include_hook_events` does not turn off the `SessionStart` and `Setup` hook events, which the CLI sends whether or not it is set (Python SDK #1336).
- `CLIInstaller::PINNED_CLI_VERSION` moves from 2.1.295 to **2.1.311**, following the CLI the Python SDK bundles. `CLIInstaller.install_pinned` installs it. See the [Claude Code changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## [1.4.2] - 2026-10-27

### Fixed
- **`bin/rails claude_agent_sdk:install_cli` (and `CLIInstaller.install` whenever `Encoding.default_internal` is set) no longer fails with `Encoding::UndefinedConversionError`** (issue #177). The download was opened with `File::BINARY`, which is 0 outside Windows, so the file was in text mode; Rails sets `default_internal` to UTF-8, and each write then transcoded the binary chunks and raised on the first byte that is not valid UTF-8. The file is now opened with `binmode: true`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-10-25

### Changed
- **`process_group: true`: a SIGKILL the SDK sends the CLI also goes to the CLI's process group.** A wedged CLI that the SDK had to kill could not stop its own children, so one still in its group that ignores stdin EOF (a stdio MCP server, for instance) kept running after the session; before `process_group` it would at least have got the terminal's Ctrl-C. The group SIGKILL goes out just before the SIGKILL of the CLI itself, whenever the SDK sends one (a normal teardown after its grace periods and SIGTERM, a cancelled teardown after its short grace, or a CLI that closed stdout and hung), and adds no delay. SIGTERM, including the one sent at interpreter exit, still goes to the CLI process only, so the CLI's own cleanup of its children still runs; a CLI that exits on SIGTERM or on its own gets no group signal, and processes that left its group are not reached. Only sessions with `process_group: true` on Unix are affected. This narrows what 1.4.0 documented ("the SDK still signals the CLI process, not its group"). See [`docs/options.md`](docs/options.md#process_group).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added
- **`ClaudeAgentOptions#process_group`** starts the CLI process in a process group of its own (issue #175). In a terminal, Ctrl-C signals the whole foreground process group, so the CLI used to get the SIGINT along with your process and end the turn on its own before your code could decide what to do. With `process_group: true` the terminal's Ctrl-C no longer reaches the CLI, and your process owns it: call `Client#interrupt` or `disconnect` from ordinary code (not from inside the signal trap, where Ruby raises `ThreadError`). Off by default, so nothing changes unless you set it. Sends nothing to the CLI; uses `pgroup: true` on Unix and `new_pgroup: true` on Windows, where it is untested. Teardown is unchanged: the SDK still signals the CLI process, not its group. Ruby only: the Python SDK's equivalent (PR #617) is unmerged as of 2026-10-25. [`docs/options.md`](docs/options.md#process_group) covers the trap pattern, when the CLI stops, and the background-group caveat for tools that read the terminal.

### Changed
- README: the Claude Code overview link (it led to a "Page not found" page) and the built-in tools link now point at `code.claude.com`. "Rails in a minute" is a section of its own after the Quick Start, and its job turns off auto-memory (`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY`) as the Rails guide's does. The hooks example defines the two callbacks it passes, the custom-tool example runs a prompt, and the Examples table lists `subagent_status_example.rb`. What a session without credentials, or with a rejected key, returns is now described in a new "Authentication Failures" section of `docs/errors.md`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-12

### Added
- **Every hook input carries `raw_input`**, the payload exactly as the CLI sent it. It used to be on `UnknownHookInput` only; a typed input copied the fields its class names and dropped the rest, so a field a newer CLI added was out of reach until the SDK learned it. Hook inputs are now built from the whole payload (every field the class declares, read from the same key as before). `#inspect` shows it on an `UnknownHookInput` only: a typed input already prints those fields as attributes.
- Hook input fields the CLI already sends (Python SDK #1331, plus the schemas of Claude Code 2.1.295): `prompt_id` and `effort` on every hook input; `duration_ms` on `PostToolUseHookInput` and `PostToolUseFailureHookInput`; `session_title` and `source` on `UserPromptSubmitHookInput`; `session_title`, `seconds_since_last_response`, `prompt_cache_likely_expired`, `context_tokens` and `estimated_cache_write_usd` on `SessionStartHookInput`; `parent_file_path` on `InstructionsLoadedHookInput`.
- Typed inputs for the hook events `PostToolBatch`, `UserPromptExpansion`, `PreModelSwitch`, `PostModelSwitch`, `DirectoryAdded` and `MessageDisplay` (`PostToolBatchHookInput`, ...), which used to arrive as `UnknownHookInput`. `HOOK_EVENTS` lists them, so it now has the CLI's 33 events.
- Hook-specific outputs from Python SDK #1331: `PostToolBatchHookSpecificOutput`, `UserPromptExpansionHookSpecificOutput`, `StopHookSpecificOutput`, `SubagentStopHookSpecificOutput`, `PreModelSwitchHookSpecificOutput`, `PostModelSwitchHookSpecificOutput`, `ElicitationHookSpecificOutput`, `ElicitationResultHookSpecificOutput`, `WorktreeCreateHookSpecificOutput` and `MessageDisplayHookSpecificOutput`; `session_title` and `suppress_original_prompt` on `UserPromptSubmitHookSpecificOutput`; `initial_user_message`, `session_title`, `watch_paths` and `reload_skills` on `SessionStartHookSpecificOutput`. A Hash return value could already send these keys; the typed classes rejected them with `ArgumentError`. `docs/hooks-and-permissions.md` now lists every output class and its fields.
- `InitMessage#capabilities`, `#plugin_errors`, `#terminal_slash_commands` and `#fast_mode_disabled_reason`, the init fields of Python SDK #1332 (`SystemInitData`) that `InitMessage` did not read. Test `capabilities` (for example for `"interrupt_receipt_v1"`) instead of comparing `claude_code_version`.

### Changed
- The repository moves to the **rubycatco** GitHub organization: `github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby`. The old `ya-luotao/...` URL redirects, and the gem on rubygems.org is unaffected; gem metadata, docs, templates and issue links now point at the new home.
- **`PermissionDeniedHookSpecificOutput#retry` defaults to `nil`** and is then left out of the output, as in Python; it used to default to `false` and always send `retry: false`, which the CLI reads the same way. Code that reads `#retry` back from a fresh instance gets `nil`.
- The `*HookSpecificOutput` classes are declared from one table of wire keys (`HookOutputKeys::HOOK_SPECIFIC`) instead of each writing its own `#to_h`. Each class still sends the same keys, except that a field set to `false` is now sent (only `nil` is left out); before, most fields also dropped `false`.
- `CLIInstaller::PINNED_CLI_VERSION` moves from 2.1.288 to **2.1.295**, following the CLI the Python SDK bundles. `CLIInstaller.install_pinned` installs it. See the [Claude Code changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-06

An internal release: three refactors that move duplicated or scattered logic into one private module each. No public API, signature (`sig/`) or documented behavior changes; one cleanup difference is noted below.

### Changed
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.query` and `Client` share one implementation of session setup, prompt writes, message delivery and teardown (`SessionAssembly`, `@api private`); a session's observers, `callback_scheduling` and `callback_wrapper` travel in one object (`Dispatch`, `@api private`) instead of being passed at every call site. The documented differences between the two entry points (what observers are told when a session cannot be opened, the `session_id` on the wire, when stdin is closed, which error wins when a close raises) are preserved and now pinned by specs that run both side by side. One cleanup difference: when a `Client` is reconnected while its previous `disconnect` is still removing the materialized directory of a store-backed resume, the finishing `disconnect` no longer clears the new session, so the new session's resume directory is removed by its own `disconnect` (it used to be left behind). (#169)
- The decision of when `query()` may close stdin lives in one private class, `Query::RunLifecycle` (the per-run end, the task ledger, the session state and the ceiling timer, with the orderings between them); `Query` feeds it events and supplies the timer. Its specs go through that interface instead of `Query`'s instance variables. (#168)
- Hash-form option interpretation (`system_prompt`, `thinking`, `tools`, `output_format`, `task_budget`, `plugins`, `sandbox`, `mcp_servers`, `agents`) lives in one private module, `OptionForms`; every existing per-option spelling and key policy is preserved as it was. (#167)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-03

Fixes from a review of the whole SDK, a reference for every option (`docs/options.md`), and Claude Code 2.1.288 as the pinned CLI. Settings the SDK used to drop without an error now take effect — hook outputs and `sandbox:` Hashes in Ruby spelling, a `tools:` String, option Hashes with a Symbol `type` — so read the entries in bold before upgrading: they say what changes for code that relied on the old behavior.

### Added
- **`docs/options.md`**: a reference for every `ClaudeAgentOptions` attribute — its type, its default, and the CLI flag, `initialize` field or environment variable it becomes — plus what an option reads when it is left out, passed as `nil` or given a configured default, and the environment variables the SDK reads. It documents options that had no entry anywhere before (`extra_args`, `include_partial_messages`, `include_hook_events`, `task_budget`, `strict_mcp_config`) and the `CLAUDE_CODE_PRINT_BG_WAIT_CEILING_MS` ceiling from 1.1.0. A spec checks every row against the code. `docs/client.md` documents the `transport:` argument of `query` / `ask`. ([#155](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/155))
- `Pathname` where a path goes: `settings:` (a settings file; used to send no `--settings` at all), `SystemPromptFile#path`, the `path` of a `{ type: 'file' }` system prompt Hash, and a plugin path, typed or Hash (these failed at connect with `no implicit conversion of Pathname into String`). `tools:` is signed `String` as well; the RBS signatures are widened accordingly. ([#160](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/160))

### Changed
- `docs/cli-installer.md` now says when `CLIInstaller::PINNED_CLI_VERSION` moves: pin-only changes ship with the next gem release rather than one release per CLI bump. It also covers how a gem patch can move your CLI and how to take a newer CLI before a release pins it. The pin-bump workflow keeps a single `[Unreleased]` entry for the pin.
- `CLIInstaller::PINNED_CLI_VERSION` moves from 2.1.285 to **2.1.288**, following the CLI the Python SDK bundles. `CLIInstaller.install_pinned` installs it. See the [Claude Code changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
- **The Rails guide and both Rails examples turn off the CLI's per-project auto-memory** (`env: { 'CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY' => '1' }`). Every SDK session reads that memory and a `claude_code`-preset session writes it without a permission check, so in a multi-user app one user's "remember …" would reach every other user's session. The generated initializer only documents the switch: it carries the same line commented out, so **a newly generated app is not isolated until you uncomment it** (or set it per call). If you copied the examples, add the line; the value must be `'1'`. ([#158](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/158))
- **`docs/configuration.md` has a "Session Isolation" section.** Claude Code's per-project auto-memory is on in SDK sessions: every session loads the project's `MEMORY.md` index into its context (`setting_sources: []` does not prevent it), and a session on the `claude_code` preset also writes memory files, which the CLI allows without any permission setup. Servers and multi-tenant hosts should set `env: { 'CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY' => '1' }` (or `settings: { autoMemoryEnabled: false }`); a custom transport has to pass either one through to its CLI itself; `Client#context_usage[:memoryFiles]` shows what a session loaded. ([#155](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/155))
- **A requested sandbox that is not active now produces a warning.** `sandbox: { enabled: true }` does not guarantee a sandbox: when the CLI cannot start one (a Linux container without `bubblewrap` and `socat`, for example) it prints `⚠ Sandbox disabled: …` to its stderr and runs commands unsandboxed, which a host only saw through a `stderr:` callback. The SDK now repeats that line as a Ruby warning, prefixed `[claude-agent-sdk]`, once per session, when the `sandbox:` option enabled the sandbox. The default is unchanged; set `fail_if_unavailable: true` to make the CLI exit instead. ([#156](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/156))
- **`OTelObserver` now leaves a span for a session that fails before its first `InitMessage`.** A CLI that could not be found or started, or an `initialize` that failed or timed out, raised to the caller but exported no span at all (0.18.0's "crashed sessions now produce OTel traces with error status" only held once an `InitMessage` had arrived). `on_error` now emits a `claude_agent.session` span with the observer's default attributes, the prompt if one had been sent, the exception event and error status, and ends it at once. The span has no model or `session.id`. Nothing changes once a trace has started. If you count `claude_agent.session` spans, failed starts are now among them. ([#148](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/148))
- `docs/observability.md` no longer promises "standard `gen_ai.*` semantic conventions … any OTel backend". The attributes follow the Langfuse and OpenInference conventions plus a subset of OTel `gen_ai.*`; the page now lists every attribute, event and status `OTelObserver` sets, and how the `gen_ai.*` names differ from the OTel GenAI semantic conventions — notably that `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` leaves cache tokens out, and that the inclusive count is `llm.token_count.prompt` on the session span. No attribute changed. ([#148](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/148))
- **`docs/rails.md` no longer says callbacks inherit the request's state.** A callback runs on a thread or fiber Rails never set up: `Current` attributes, `Time.zone`, log tags, the error context and the `connected_to` role / shard read as their defaults there (a write under `connected_to(shard:)` lands in the default shard), with or without `Railtie.callback_wrapper`; `I18n.locale` depends on the i18n version. The guide now has the table, a per-call recipe that carries the state across, the rule for composing your own wrapper with the Rails one, a section on transactions and the connection pool (a callback is outside the caller's transaction and uses its own connection), and a note that in development an agent run holds the reload lock. ([#158](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/158))
- `docs/configuration.md` says what the CLI does with an invalid sandbox value: it discards the whole `--settings` value, sandbox and `permissions` rules alike. The SDK does not surface this — `connect` succeeds and nothing appears on stderr; only the CLI's `get_settings` control response lists the error. That holds for every form, the typed classes included. ([#160](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/160))
- Disk listings (`list_sessions`, `get_session_info`) scan each transcript's head and tail windows as bytes; with non-ASCII text in a window this takes a fraction of the CPU time it did. Results are unchanged. ([#157](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/157))
- Development only: the gemspec's development dependency on Bundler is `>= 2.0` (was `~> 2.0`), so `bundle install` works in a checkout on Ruby 4.0, which ships Bundler 4. CI now runs the suite and RuboCop on Ruby 4.0, and a keyless smoke runs the pinned CLI on PRs that touch the installer, the transport, `Query` or the message parser; the API-key integration job shows as skipped instead of passed when the key is absent. Runtime dependencies are unchanged. ([#153](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/153))

### Fixed
- **A hook callback's Hash return value now means what the equivalent typed output means, whatever its key style.** Only five top-level keys were renamed before, and only as Symbols, so `{ hook_specific_output: { hook_event_name: 'PreToolUse', permission_decision: 'deny' } }` reached the CLI under keys it does not read: the decision was ignored and the tool ran. A String-keyed Hash (e.g. after `JSON.parse`) and a `SyncHookJSONOutput` holding a snake_case Hash failed the same way. The fields the typed output classes model are now accepted in snake_case or camelCase, as Symbols or Strings, at the top level and inside `hook_specific_output`; any other key is sent as written, and the keys inside `updated_input`, the tool outputs and a `PermissionRequest` `decision` are not renamed. **If a hook of yours returns snake_case keys, they now take effect.** When one Hash spells a field both ways the CLI's spelling is sent, and a Symbol and a String spelling the same key are written once (json 3.x used to fail the hook with `detected duplicate key`). ([#149](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/149))
- **A `sandbox:` Hash written in Ruby spelling is now applied.** The typed sandbox classes take snake_case attributes and write the camelCase keys the CLI reads, but a Hash was forwarded as written: `sandbox: { enabled: true, network: { denied_domains: ['evil.example'] }, filesystem: { deny_read: ['~/.aws'] } }` reached the CLI under keys it does not know, and the CLI ignored them without an error — the session ran with `network: {}` and `filesystem: {}`, no deny rule. `SandboxSettings.new(network: { denied_domains: [...] })` lost its rules the same way. The fields of `SandboxSettings`, `SandboxNetworkConfig` and `SandboxFilesystemConfig` are now accepted in snake_case or camelCase, as Symbols or Strings, at the top level and inside `network` / `filesystem`; any other key is sent as written. **If a sandbox Hash of yours has snake_case keys, they now take effect.** A snake_case key is renamed only when its value has the shape the CLI accepts for it (`true` / `false`, an Array of Strings, a port number from 0 to 65535); with any other value it is sent as written and stays without effect, as before — so the rename can never make the CLI discard your settings. When one Hash spells a field both ways the camelCase one is sent; a field holding `nil` is left out (the CLI rejects `null` there); a Symbol and a String spelling the same key are written once. A typed `SandboxNetworkConfig` / `SandboxFilesystemConfig` inside a `sandbox:` Hash is written as the Hash it stands for (it reached the CLI as its `#inspect` text, which made the CLI drop the sandbox). ([#160](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/160))
- **"Always allow" answers from `can_use_tool` now stick for whole-tool rules.** `PermissionUpdate#to_h` wrote `"ruleContent": null` for a rule without content and omitted a nil `destination`; the CLI accepts neither and drops the **whole** `updatedPermissions` array when one entry is malformed, so `PermissionResultAllow.new(updated_permissions: context.suggestions)` silently persisted nothing for the suggestions the CLI builds for `WebSearch` or MCP tools, and the callback was asked again on every call. `ruleContent` is now omitted when nil, and an update that has a `type` but no `destination` is sent to `'session'` (this run only; no settings file is written). ([#149](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/149))
- **`tools: 'Read,Grep'` is no longer ignored.** A String had no branch in the command builder, so no `--tools` flag was sent and the session got every built-in tool. It is now passed to `--tools` as written (the CLI's own comma-separated form). **If you pass `tools:` as a String, the session is now restricted to the tools it names.** ([#160](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/160))
- **`system_prompt`, `tools`, `output_format` and `plugins` Hashes accept a Symbol `type`**, like `thinking` and the MCP server configs already did. `tools: { type: :preset, preset: :claude_code }` sent the Hash's JSON text as a tool name and the session started with **no tools**; `system_prompt: { type: :custom, prompt: '…' }` (and `:file`, `:preset`) sent no flag, so the prompt and its options were dropped; `output_format: { type: :json_schema, schema: {…} }` made the CLI exit; `plugins: [{ type: :local, … }]` raised `Unsupported plugin type`. An `output_format` Hash with `type` and `schema` under different key styles silently turned structured output off; `schema` is now found under either. A Symbol-typed Hash means what the String-typed one means, including its check: `{ type: :custom }` without a `:prompt` String raises the same `ArgumentError`. ([#160](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/160))
- **Directory-scoped session APIs could read and modify another project's sessions.** For project paths over 200 characters, `list_sessions(directory: B)`, `get_session_messages` and `rename_session` / `tag_session` / `delete_session` / `fork_session` fell back to ANY project directory sharing the first 200 characters, so they could return or change the sessions of a sibling path A. In a directory found by that fallback, only sessions whose own transcript records the requested path as its top-level `cwd` are listed, read or modified (worktrees whose paths share such a directory are each listed). ([#157](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/157))
- **A relative CLI path could run a different binary than the one the SDK checked.** The version probe runs in the process's working directory but the CLI is spawned in `cwd:`, so `cli_path: 'bin/claude'`, or a `claude` found through a relative `PATH` entry (`bin`, `.`, an empty entry), was checked in one directory and executed in the other — whatever file sat at that path inside the directory the agent was pointed at. The transport now settles one absolute path and uses it for both: a relative `cli_path` is resolved against the process's working directory (a leading `~` is expanded), and a bare name is looked up on `PATH` by the SDK, with relative `PATH` entries resolved against the process's working directory. Discovery no longer runs `which`: the SDK searches the process's `PATH` for `claude` itself, so a `which` found through a relative `PATH` entry can neither run nor redirect the lookup (a host without a `which` program now finds `claude` on `PATH`; with no `PATH` at all, discovery searches the system directories, never the working directory). If you relied on a relative `cli_path` resolving inside `cwd:`, pass an absolute path. A subclass whose `#build_command` runs the CLI through another program (docker exec, ssh) still gets `cli_path` as given, since it names a file on the far side. ([#156](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/156))
- **`#inspect` no longer prints credentials held outside `env` and `headers`.** `ClaudeAgentOptions#inspect` (and `#to_s`, `pp`, string interpolation) now filters `settings` and `extra_args` the way it filters `env`: a Hash keeps its keys with `"[FILTERED]"` values, and a String `settings` (JSON or a file path) prints as `"[FILTERED]"`. `mcp_servers` given as a String (JSON or a file path) prints as `"[FILTERED]"` too. `McpStdioServerConfig#args` is filtered. The `url` of `McpHttpServerConfig` / `McpSSEServerConfig` prints as scheme, host and port only (`"https://mcp.example.com/[FILTERED]"`), since a token can sit in its userinfo, path or query. Raw Hash server configs are filtered the same way (`type`, `command` and the redacted `url` are shown; `args`, `env`, `headers` and any other key print as `"[FILTERED]"`): inside `mcp_servers`, where they used to rely on the nesting limit, and in `McpServerStatus#config`, where the CLI echoes each server's `headers`, `url` and `args` back in `mcp_status`. Display only: the objects are not modified and nothing sent to the CLI changes. ([#151](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/151))
- **A materialized resume directory preserved after a mirror failure now holds only `projects/`.** The cleanup removed four known files and left whatever else the CLI had written — including `backups/.claude.json.backup.<ts>`, a full copy of the seeded `.claude.json`, which can hold MCP header secrets. Every entry except `projects/` is now deleted. To do that safely the SDK first moves the directory into a fresh private one next to it (`claude-preserved-resume-*`), so **the preserved transcript is no longer at the temp dir's old path: the warning names the new one.** If what it moved is not the directory it created (the path had been replaced by a symlink or another directory), or it cannot be moved, nothing is deleted and the warning says the scrub was skipped and why; symlinks are never followed, permissions are repaired only on the directory that was checked, an entry that cannot be removed is named in the warning, and an interrupted scrub says which directory to remove once the transcript is imported. Calling `disconnect` again after a teardown that was interrupted while it preserved the directory no longer deletes it. ([#159](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/159))
- **`ClaudeAgentSDK::Railtie.callback_wrapper` no longer reports to `Rails.error`.** In production it ran callbacks inside `executor.wrap`, which reports whatever passes through it as an unhandled error: a message-block exception was reported from the callback thread with an empty context (and then skipped by the request / job layer as already reported), exceptions the SDK handles itself (hook, `can_use_tool`, SDK MCP tool, observer) were reported although the run continued, and — on Rails 7.2.3, 8.0.2 and later — so were the SDK's own cancellations under `callback_scheduling: :inline`. The wrapper now enters the executor with `run!` / `complete!` (same hooks, no report), so an exception that escapes a callback is reported once, by the layer that called the SDK, with its controller / job context. If you relied on those reports to see hook or tool failures, report them inside the callback (`Rails.error.report`). ([#158](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/158))
- **A callback that fails with `NotImplementedError`, `LoadError`, `SystemStackError` or `SecurityError` is answered like any other failing callback.** These are not `StandardError`s, so nothing rescued them when a hook, a `can_use_tool` callback, an SDK MCP tool, resource or prompt handler, or the `callback_wrapper` raised one: the CLI never got a response for that request, and the exception stopped the whole Async reactor, taking every other session and task on it down (`query()` raised the raw exception). Now hooks and `can_use_tool` get the error response, a tool handler's failure reaches the model as an `isError: true` result, and a resource or prompt handler gets the JSON-RPC `-32603` error, exactly as for a `RuntimeError`; the session carries on. `SdkMcpServer#call_tool` called directly returns the `isError` result for these exceptions instead of raising. `exit`, `Interrupt`, signals and cancellation behave as before, and `NoMemoryError` is still fatal. ([#150](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/150))
- **A callback failure whose message is not valid UTF-8 is answered.** When a hook or `can_use_tool` callback raised an exception whose message held invalid bytes (a multibyte character cut by `byteslice`, binary subprocess or HTTP output), building the error response raised `JSON::GeneratorError` and the CLI was never answered. On the process-exit path the same error replaced the `SystemExit` the SDK promises to re-raise: under `:inline` scheduling `exit` did not end the process. An `exit` or signal exception whose message was in an encoding that is not ASCII-compatible (UTF-16) failed the same way, with `Encoding::CompatibilityError`. The error text is now normalized first — invalid bytes become U+FFFD, text in another valid encoding is transcoded — and a response that still cannot be serialized is replaced by a fixed message, so the request is always answered and the original exception is the one re-raised. ([#150](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/150))
- **`query()` with a streamed (Enumerator) prompt no longer closes stdin right after writing a message.** With hooks, `can_use_tool` or SDK MCP servers, stdin could close before that message's turn had produced a frame, so the turn's hook, permission and SDK MCP requests failed with "Stream closed". It happened when the CLI's `idle` for the previous run and the next message became ready in the same reactor pass: `Query#end_run` stopped the between-turns ceiling task (which yields) before it marked the run ended, and the message joined the run that was about to end. The run is now marked ended first. ([#154](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/154))
- **A `Client` control method called from a fiber on another thread's reactor no longer breaks the session.** `interrupt`, `set_model`, `set_permission_mode`, `mcp_status`, … called through `Sync { client.interrupt }` on a request thread while the session runs on a background reactor, or from a `Sync` block inside a `:thread`-mode callback: on async 2.10–2.28 the response raised `FiberError: fiber called across threads` in the session's read loop, which ended the session and left the caller waiting for the control-request timeout (20 minutes by default); on async ≥ 2.29 the response could be missed, with the same wait. Such callers now wait the way plain threads already did. ([#154](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/154))
- **`receive_response` / `receive_messages` no longer hang after the CLI is gone.** After the CLI exited or crashed while a `Client` was connected, the first call raised the stream error (or returned the last turn), the second returned without messages, and every later call hung forever with no error and no timeout (from plain Ruby after the reactor had finished, async 2.10 raised `NoMethodError` instead). Every call after the end of the stream now returns at once; the stream error is still raised once. ([#154](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/154))
- **A deadline around a `Client` call is no longer swallowed while an observer runs.** With observers configured, a deadline around `Client#receive_response`, `#receive_messages`, `#query` or `#disconnect` (`task.with_timeout`, or `Timeout.timeout` inside a reactor) was silently dropped when it expired while an observer callback was still running: nothing was raised and the turn carried on, calling the message block after the deadline. Only what the observer (or its `callback_wrapper`) raises is contained now. With `callback_scheduling: :inline` the observer runs on the caller's own fiber, where such a deadline cannot be told from the observer's own failure, and it is still contained. ([#154](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/154))
- **`Client#disconnect`, and the cleanup of a failing `Client#connect`, always tear the session down.** When the call was interrupted while an observer's `on_close` / `on_error` was running — the caller's task stopped (`Async::Stop`), or an inline hook's cooperative timeout fired — the CLI process, the session's read loop and the materialized resume directory (with its credentials copy) were left behind. The teardown now always runs, and the interruption propagates after it. ([#154](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/154))
- **A `Client#disconnect` from another thread completes the CLI's graceful shutdown.** From an application thread, or from a tool handler, hook or `can_use_tool` callback under the default `callback_scheduling: :thread`, the close was handed to a transient task on the session's reactor; when the session had nothing else left to do the reactor wound down and stopped that task mid-teardown, so the CLI got SIGTERM instead of stdin EOF and its 5-second grace period (the time it has to finish its last session write), and `disconnect` returned before the child was reaped. The close now runs on a task the reactor waits for: such a `disconnect` takes as long as the teardown, like one made on the reactor. ([#161](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/161))
- **A callback's thread hop no longer returns before the callback has finished.** When an exception (`Async::Stop`, a timeout) had been raised into the waiting fiber just as the previous hop's thread ended, the stale wakeup resumed the next hop, which returned `nil` as its result; with a `timeout:` (session-store adapter calls) the same wakeup was reported as `timed out` although no time had passed. `FiberBoundary.invoke` now waits until the thread has really finished or the deadline has really passed. ([#154](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/154))
- An error raised by `ClaudeAgentSDK.query` / `.ask` from synchronous code (CLI not found, `ProcessError`, `ResultError`, an exception in your own block) was also logged by Async as `Task may have ended with unhandled exception.`, with the message and a backtrace, even when your code rescued it. The error is now only raised. Inside a reactor the same applied to failures before the first suspension, such as a transport that cannot connect. ([#154](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/154))
- **A `stderr:` callback that raised `NotImplementedError`, `LoadError` or `SystemStackError` could hang the session.** Only `StandardError` was contained, so those ended the thread that reads the CLI's stderr; once the CLI had written another 64 KiB of stderr it blocked for good. They are now handled like any other callback error: dropped, and the callback is called again for the next line. The same holds for a `debug_stderr:` sink and for the SDK's own sandbox warning when a custom `Warning.warn` or `$stderr` raises one of them. ([#156](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/156))
- **Store-backed resume now authenticates on macOS with a custom `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.** There the CLI keeps its OAuth credentials in the Keychain under `Claude Code-credentials-<first 8 hex of SHA-256(config dir)>` and writes no `.credentials.json`; the SDK only bridged the default config dir's entry, so the resumed subprocess reported "Not logged in" (and the failed attempt was mirrored into the store). The Keychain is now consulted for a custom config dir too — only when that directory has no `.credentials.json`, and never under `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. The seeded copy still has the refresh token removed and mode `0600`. ([#159](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/159))
- **A mirror flush cancelled while it waited behind an in-flight append no longer loses its batch.** The batcher detached the pending entries before queueing on its lock, so a `#flush` whose task was stopped there (a timeout around the caller, `Task#stop`) dropped them: they never reached the store and no `MirrorErrorMessage` was produced. The buffer is now detached inside the lock, so those entries go out with the next flush; a frame that arrives while the final flush is still waiting is delivered rather than counted as dropped (Python [#1289](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1289)). The mirror's retry backoff uses `Kernel#sleep` instead of the deprecated `Async::Task#sleep`. ([#159](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/159))
- **`get_session_messages` and `get_subagent_messages` (disk and `session_store:`) no longer drop the results of parallel tool calls.** The CLI parents each `tool_result` on the entry holding its own `tool_use`, so with several tool calls in one assistant turn only the last-written result lay on the path the readers walk; the others were silently missing, leaving `tool_use` blocks without a `tool_result`. They are now returned, after the turn's `tool_use` messages and before the result the conversation continued from; the chain's own result wins, so a call answered again after a rewind is not returned twice, and the result of a branch a rewind dropped is not brought back. Affected sessions return more messages than before, so `offset:`/`limit:` pages over them shift. ([#157](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/157))
- **Session reads, listings and mutations — other fixes** ([#157](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/157)):
  - `get_session_messages` (disk and store) no longer returns `[]` for a session whose last entry is an unanswered meta injection (a slash-command or skill body, a stop-hook message, a system reminder written just before the session was closed).
  - The message readers no longer raise `Encoding::CompatibilityError` under a non-UTF-8 locale (`LANG=C` / `LC_ALL=C`), nor on a transcript whose last line was cut inside a multibyte character or that holds a raw non-UTF-8 byte (a torn line is skipped; invalid bytes come back as U+FFFD); `import_session_to_store` no longer stops half-way on such a line. Under `LC_ALL=C` a non-ASCII `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `directory: Dir.pwd` and a non-ASCII worktree path no longer raise or hide every worktree.
  - `list_sessions(directory:)` no longer leaves out the directory's own sessions when it is a subdirectory of a repository with several git worktrees; worktree paths git reports in decomposed Unicode form are NFC-normalized.
  - Project paths containing a character outside the BMP (an emoji, a CJK Extension B ideograph) map to the project directory the CLI creates (two hyphens per such character). **`project_key_for_directory` changes for affected paths**: store entries written under the old key by `import_session_to_store` or the store mutations no longer match (the transcript mirror never used that key).
  - `rename_session`, `tag_session`, `fork_session` and `delete_session` no longer raise `Errno::ENOENT` when `directory:` names a removed project directory (a deleted worktree); a missing path is resolved as far as it exists, following symlinks whose target is gone and applying a `..` after a link to the link's target, as `os.path.realpath` does.
  - `list_sessions` no longer returns `[]` when the config directory path contains `[` or `{`.
  - Disk listings find a first prompt beyond the first 64 KiB of the transcript (a bounded scan of up to 1 MiB) and take `created_at` only from a top-level `timestamp`, as the store path does; `created_at` is no longer 1 ms low for about one ISO timestamp in eight. `docs/sessions.md` lists what the disk path still does not see.
  - `fork_session` without `title:` names the fork after the title the listing shows for the source, on disk and with `session_store:` alike.
  - `get_session_info(session_store:)` reports the adapter's `mtime` as `last_modified`, as `list_sessions(session_store:)` does; the store subagent readers skip non-String `list_subkeys` values; `rename_session` / `tag_session` raise `ArgumentError` for a title or tag that is not a usable String (`tag: false` used to clear the tag, only `nil` does; a binary String, as `File.binread` returns, is read as UTF-8 instead of failing later with a JSON or encoding error); `list_subagents` on disk returns each id once.
  - An optional `SessionStore` method that raises `NotImplementedError` when called (a stub behind a delegating wrapper, an adapter declining at run time) is treated as not implemented — the documented fallback is taken and `run_session_store_conformance` skips its contracts — while a required `load` that raises still fails the resume.
  - `docs/sessions.md`: rename / tag / fork are safe while the session's CLI runs; delete only sessions whose CLI has exited.
- **`CLIInstaller.install` no longer deadlocks when two fibers of one `Async` reactor install into the same directory.** The second fiber blocked the reactor thread in `flock` while the first, which held the lock, was waiting on the network inside the critical section, so neither returned; with the default `version: 'stable'` this happened even when nothing needed installing. A waiting installer now polls the lock (every 50 ms) instead of blocking its thread. Threads and separate processes were never affected, and mutual exclusion is unchanged. ([#152](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/152))
- **`CLIInstaller.install` / `install_pinned` no longer fail in a read-only install directory when the requested version is already installed.** In an image built as root and run as another user, or on a read-only root filesystem, a boot-time `install_pinned` raised `CLIInstallError` (`EACCES`) because the lock file could not be opened, although the binary was intact. When the lock file cannot be opened (`EACCES`, `EROFS`, `EPERM`), a concrete version that is installed and matches its recorded checksum and platform is now returned without the lock. A dist-tag (`'stable'` / `'latest'`), a different version or a damaged binary still raises there. ([#152](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/152))
- **`CLIInstaller` honors `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`.** `Net::HTTP` only looks at `http_proxy` unless it is told otherwise, even for a TLS connection, so an environment that exported only `HTTPS_PROXY` was bypassed, and where direct egress is blocked the install timed out with no mention of the proxy. The proxy for each request (redirect hops included) is now resolved from the `https` URL and passed explicitly, with its credentials; `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy` apply as before, and an environment that only sets `http_proxy` keeps working. `ALL_PROXY` is not read, and only `http://` proxy URLs are used. `docs/cli-installer.md` has a new "Proxies and custom CAs" section (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`). ([#152](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/152))
- **`CLIInstaller` fsyncs what it publishes.** The downloaded binary and `VERSION` are flushed to disk before they are renamed into place (the binary again after it is made executable, so its mode survives too), and the directory after it (best-effort). Previously a power loss shortly after an install could leave an empty or partial executable `claude` under the published name, which discovery kept selecting until the next `install`. ([#152](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/152))
- `CLIInstaller.install` with no `dir:` names the default directory (`vendor/claude`) in its error when the process's working directory no longer exists, instead of an empty path. `docs/cli-installer.md` states the locked sequence in the order the code uses (record `VERSION`, then place the binary), and that a failed first install never publishes a binary — it can leave the directory, its lock file and, after a failed final rename, a recorded `VERSION`. ([#152](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/152))
- **Shorthand tool schemas with `Array` / `Hash` parameters are advertised correctly.** `{ order_id: Integer, tags: Array }` told the model `tags` was a string, so it sent `"fragile,gift"` and the handler got a String; a model that did send an array had the call rejected. `Array` / `:array` now map to `array` and `Hash` / `:object` to `object`, in `tools/list` and in `tools/call` argument validation alike. Other shorthand values are unchanged. `docs/mcp-servers.md` lists the shorthand types. ([#152](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/152))
- **A tool handler that returns a non-Array `:content` gets a clear error.** `{ content: 'text' }`, a single block Hash, or a present `false` or `nil`, was forwarded unchanged; the CLI rejected it and told the model the server "returned a malformed result", so the text never arrived. It is now an in-band `isError` result naming the tool: `Tool 'x' must return :content as an Array of content blocks (got String)`. A result without a `:content` key keeps the existing message. Return the String itself, or `content: [{ type: 'text', text: ... }]`. ([#152](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/152))
- **`create_tool(annotations: { maxResultSizeChars: … }, meta: { … })` keeps the size hint.** An explicit `meta:` replaced the `_meta['anthropic/maxResultSizeChars']` entry derived from the annotation, so large results were truncated to a preview again. The two are now merged; a size key set in `meta:` wins. ([#152](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/152))
- **`OTelObserver` no longer counts an API response's token usage once per content block.** The CLI sends one `AssistantMessage` per content block, and each repeats the response's `message_id` and `usage`. The observer put that usage on every `claude_agent.generation` span, so a response with a thinking block and a tool call reported its input, cache-read and cache-creation tokens twice (N times for N blocks). The `gen_ai.usage.*` token attributes are now set on the first generation span of each `message_id` only. Span count, names and parentage are unchanged, and the session span was already correct. **Sums of `gen_ai.usage.*` over generation spans drop by the duplication factor.** `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` on a generation span is still the snapshot taken when the response started; `docs/observability.md` now says so, and that the session span carries the authoritative totals. ([#148](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/148))
- `examples/advanced_hooks_example.rb` and `examples/lifecycle_hooks_example.rb` returned a `*HookSpecificOutput#to_h` as the whole hook output, which leaves `permissionDecision`, `additionalContext`, `retry` and `watchPaths` at the top level where the CLI does not read them — the example's "deny" did not deny. They now wrap the typed output in `SyncHookJSONOutput`. If you copied that pattern, wrap yours the same way (or return `{ hook_specific_output: … }`). ([#149](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/149))
- `agents:` accepts a Hash for an agent, as its signature says: `agents: { reviewer: { description: '…', prompt: '…' } }` used to raise `NoMethodError` at connect. The Hash is read like `AgentDefinition.new(hash)`, so a misspelled key raises the same `ArgumentError`. ([#149](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/149))
- `allowed_tools`, `disallowed_tools`, `add_dirs`, `extra_args`, `env` and `load_timeout_ms` can be set back to `nil` after construction (`options.dup_with(allowed_tools: nil)`, `options.extra_args = nil`), as their signatures say. The command builder, the transport and store-backed resume used to raise an anonymous `NoMethodError` at connect; they now read `nil` as the default. ([#149](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/149), [#156](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/156), [#159](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/159))
- The `sandbox:` option now replaces a `sandbox` section already present in `settings:` instead of being added beside it. Settings given as a JSON String, a file path or a String-keyed Hash produced a `--settings` value with the key twice: under json 3.x connect raised a raw `JSON::GeneratorError: detected duplicate key "sandbox"`, which made the documented `sandbox: false` override unusable; under json 2.x it only worked as long as the CLI kept the last duplicate. ([#149](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/149))
- Hooks registered for one event under both a String and a Symbol key (`{ 'PreToolUse' => [a], PreToolUse: [b] }`) are all registered, in the order written. The second key used to replace the first silently, so `a` never ran. ([#149](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/149))
- **`#[]` returns `nil` for a writer's name instead of raising.** `msg[:session_id=]`, `msg['sessionId=']` and `options[:env=]` called the setter without an argument (`ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments`); they now read as `nil`, like any other name that is not an attribute. ([#151](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/151))
- **`ClaudeAgentOptions` reports `'[]'` as an unknown option.** `ClaudeAgentOptions.new('[]' => 1)` raised `wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2)`; it now raises the usual `unknown ClaudeAgentOptions option: "[]"`. The keys `'='`, `'!'` and `'=='` used to resolve to `#==`, `#!=` and `#===` and were dropped without an error; they now raise the same `ArgumentError`. Setters you define on your own `ClaudeAgentOptions` subclass are still accepted. ([#151](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/151))
- **`Type#inspect` no longer raises on a value it cannot render.** A `BasicObject` attribute raised `NoMethodError` (`nil?`), and a String, Hash or Array subclass whose `#length` / `#size` raises took `#inspect` down with it — inside a logger or `puts`. Such a value now shows as `#<ClassName>` (`#<?>` for a `BasicObject`) and the rest of the object still prints. `Interrupt`, `SystemExit` and other non-`StandardError` exceptions are not rescued. ([#151](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/151))
- **`cli_path:` given as a `Pathname` failed at connect.** The signature has always allowed it, but the spawn raised `no implicit conversion of Pathname into String`. The transport now converts it once, before the version check and the spawn. ([#156](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/156))
- No more `Async::Task#sleep is deprecated` warnings under `ruby -w` from the transport: while it waited for the CLI to exit, or for the version check, it printed one every 50 ms. It now uses `Kernel#sleep`, which parks only the calling fiber on a reactor. ([#156](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/156))
- The Postgres reference adapter (`examples/session_stores/`) stores entries in a `json` column instead of `jsonb`, which rejects the JSON escape for U+0000: one transcript entry with a NUL character (binary tool output) failed the whole `INSERT` and the mirror dropped that batch. An existing table is not changed by `create_schema`; the README gives the migration (`ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN entry TYPE json USING entry::json`). ([#159](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/159))
- **`.yardopts` is packaged in the gem.** rubydoc.info builds the API reference from the gem's own files; without it YARD ran with its defaults, so the reference listed every `@api private` internal (`Query`, `FiberBoundary`, `MessageParser`, …) next to the public API and did not render `CHANGELOG.md` or `UPGRADING-1.0.md`. Takes effect on rubydoc.info from this release on. ([#155](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/155))
- **Documentation that contradicted the code** ([#155](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/155)):
  - `docs/types.md` lists every message and content-block class the SDK can yield (`ToolProgressMessage`, `AuthStatusMessage`, `ToolUseSummaryMessage`, `PromptSuggestionMessage`, `ServerToolUseBlock` and `ServerToolResultBlock` were missing), with a table of the system and progress messages and what `#data` holds; the `SandboxIgnoreViolations` row (removed in 0.12.0) is gone. `docs/errors.md` documents `CLIInstallError`, and that a control request the CLI rejects raises a plain `StandardError`, not a `ClaudeSDKError`.
  - Hooks, custom tools and permission callbacks do not require `Client` (`docs/client.md`, the README and the bundled skill said they did); `query()` and `ask` have run all three for many releases.
  - The custom-transport contract is stated once: `connect`, `write`, `read_messages`, `end_input` and `close` are required, `ready?` is optional. `docs/client.md` listed six methods and the bundled skill four (a transport written from the skill's list made `query()` hang). The YARD of `ClaudeAgentSDK::Transport` no longer calls it an internal API.
  - README: links are absolute GitHub URLs (relative ones were 404 on rubydoc.info, and the banner was missing from the installed gem); the CLI install snippet uses `CLIInstaller.install_pinned` instead of the literal `2.1.220`; a new Authentication section says how the CLI authenticates and what a missing login looks like; the comparison table's Python column is corrected.
  - The bundled skill's configure examples no longer put `ENV.fetch('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')` into the default options (the CLI inherits the environment anyway, and the line made every boot without the key raise `KeyError`); the skill and `docs/options.md` say that a `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` naming a missing file is skipped and discovery continues.
  - Four clarifications, each checked against Claude Code 2.1.287: `sandbox: { enabled: true }` does not make the sandbox a requirement (set `fail_if_unavailable: true`; otherwise the CLI warns on stderr and runs unsandboxed); `setting_sources: []` does not stop the MCP servers of the logged-in claude.ai account (`strict_mcp_config: true` does); `Client#query(prompt, session_id:)` does not start a separate conversation; an explicit `tools:` list must include `'Skill'` for `skills:` to work. Sandbox settings travel inside `--settings`, not a `--sandbox` flag.
  - The `Client` examples in the guides and the `Client` YARD use `Client.open` (the `connect` … `disconnect` shape they showed leaves the session open when the block raises).
  - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` no longer declares a version for the plugin (it said `0.13.1`); `SECURITY.md` states the supported versions for 1.x; `examples/message_types_example.rb` handles all 28 typed message classes.
  - In the pages other PRs of this batch own: the documented Gemfile lines for the OpenTelemetry setup list the `base64` gem, which is no longer a default gem on Ruby 3.4 (`docs/observability.md`, [#148](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/148)); `docs/cli-installer.md` says an unusable `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` is skipped without a warning and discovery continues, instead of "no discovery at all" ([#156](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/156)); `docs/rails.md` says hooks and custom tools work with `query` too ([#158](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/pull/158)).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-30

Syncs with Python SDK 0.2.162. Additive only: one new option and a fix to when `query()` closes stdin.

### Added
- **`ClaudeAgentOptions#verbatim_prompts`** (default `false`; Python SDK #1269). When `true`, every user message the SDK writes carries `client_composed: true`: String prompts and each message of a streamed prompt, through `query`, `Client#connect` and `Client#query`. Claude Code then delivers the text as written, with no `@path` file expansion and no slash-command dispatch. Use it when a prompt includes text your end user did not type. `tools: []` and `disallowed_tools` do not stop `@path` expansion, which reads the file before the model runs. While the option is on, a caller's `client_composed` key is overwritten, and caller Hashes are never mutated. A streamed JSONL String is parsed and re-serialized; one that is not a single JSON object raises `ArgumentError` rather than going out unmarked. `Client` reads the option once, at `connect`. On current CLIs such a turn also skips the turn-start attachment pass (nested `CLAUDE.md` and rules files, skill and tool listings). Requires Claude Code 2.1.248 or later; the SDK warns when it connects to an older CLI with the option on. See `docs/configuration.md`.
- Development only, nothing ships in the gem: TLA+ models in `formal/tla/` of the two most concurrency-sensitive designs. `CLIInstaller.tla` covers `CLIInstaller.install`'s publish order, the in-lock dist-tag resolve and the stale-temp sweep. `ControlProtocol.tla` covers the outbound control-request waiter protocol in `Query`. `formal/tla/run.sh` model-checks both with TLC. It confirms that the shipped design passes and that each alternative the source comments reject, including the historical rename-then-record order, produces a counterexample.

### Changed
- `CLIInstaller::PINNED_CLI_VERSION` moves from 2.1.280 (the 1.0.0 pin) to **2.1.285**, the CLI the Python SDK 0.2.162 bundles. `CLIInstaller.install_pinned` installs it. It honors both `client_composed` (`verbatim_prompts`) and `CLAUDE_CODE_SDK_READS_SESSION_STATE` (the fix below).

### Fixed
- **`query()` with hooks, `can_use_tool` or SDK MCP servers no longer closes stdin while a follow-up turn is still owed** (Python SDK #1279, fixing Python issue #1190). A background subagent that finished just before the turn's result was already off the in-flight ledger, so stdin closed at that result, and the follow-up turn its completion triggered had every hook, permission and SDK MCP request fail with "Stream closed" (the model reported the tool as refused). The transport now sets `CLAUDE_CODE_SDK_READS_SESSION_STATE=1` unless `options.env` or the environment already names it (in any case; a `nil` value in `options.env` unsets it). The CLI then sends `session_state_changed` frames marked `sdk_host_only`, which the SDK drops from the message stream for `query()` and `Client` alike. `query()` keeps stdin open until the CLI reports `idle` after a result:
  - The wait between turns is bounded by `CLAUDE_CODE_PRINT_BG_WAIT_CEILING_MS`, read from `options.env` and then the environment; the default is 10 minutes and `0` means no limit. The clock restarts at each result and at each `running`. A main-thread turn, the CLI reporting `requires_action`, a tracked background agent and a hook, permission or SDK MCP request the SDK is still answering each stop it.
  - With an Enumerable prompt, each message written waits for its own run. Work the CLI takes up after the run ended reopens it.
  - A CLI that sends no state (2.1.282 and earlier) gets the old behavior: stdin closes at the first result with no tracked task in flight.
  - Background agents, bounded monitors and MCP tasks can now keep a one-shot run open, up to the ceiling. Background shells, persistent monitors and remote agents do not, because the CLI leaves them out of its `running` report.
  - `SessionStateChangedMessage` reaches your code only if you set `CLAUDE_CODE_EMIT_SESSION_STATE_EVENTS=1` yourself; the SDK never sets it.
  - A custom transport must pass `CLAUDE_CODE_SDK_READS_SESSION_STATE=1` to the CLI itself to get this behavior (see `docs/client.md`); the E2B example transport now does.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-23

**1.0 is a stability commitment.** From here on the public API — everything documented in `docs/` plus the YARD docs without `@api private`, now also described by the RBS signatures in `sig/` — follows Semantic Versioning: no breaking changes within 1.x. Upgrading from 0.x? Read [UPGRADING-1.0.md](UPGRADING-1.0.md) and run your suite on 0.37 first.

1.0 ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)): three breaking changes, the first two of which 0.37 warns about at the call site. **Read [UPGRADING-1.0.md](UPGRADING-1.0.md) before upgrading** and run your suite on 0.37 with warnings visible first: an app that runs on 0.37 without SDK warnings is unaffected by those two, except that `respond_to?` on a camelCase non-attribute (`msg.respond_to?(:toH)`) silently answered `true` on 0.37 and answers `false` now.

### Added
- **`ClaudeAgentSDK::SessionStoreError`** (a `ClaudeSDKError`), raised by `query`, `ask` and `Client#connect` when resuming from `session_store:` fails: a store call (`#load`, `#list_sessions`, `#list_subkeys`) raised or exceeded `load_timeout_ms` while the SDK materialized the transcript. The message names the store call, and `#cause` holds the adapter's exception (or the timeout). Documented in `docs/errors.md` and `docs/sessions.md`.
- **RBS signatures for the public API** ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)). The gem now ships `sig/`, so Steep and other RBS tools type-check code that uses it (through `rbs collection`; `sig/manifest.yaml` declares the one stdlib dependency, `pathname`). The signatures cover the whole public surface (the objects documented in `docs/` and YARD without `@api private`): `ClaudeAgentSDK.query` / `.ask` / `.configure` / `.offload`, the SDK MCP helpers, every session function (including `session_store:` and the deprecated twins), `Client` with its Ruby-style aliases, `ClaudeAgentOptions` (every option as a typed keyword), the message, content-block, hook, permission and MCP types, the error hierarchy, `CLIInstaller`, `Streaming`, `Railtie.callback_wrapper` and the observers. Duck types are interfaces, so any object with the right methods fits: `_Transport`, `_SessionStore` (only `#append` and `#load` are required), and one interface per user callback (`_CanUseTool`, `_HookCallback`, `_ToolHandler`, `_CallbackWrapper`, ...). Hashes follow the documented key rule: `wire_hash` (`Hash[Symbol, untyped]`) for data from the CLI stream, `transcript_hash` (`Hash[String, untyped]`) for transcripts and store data. Internals tagged `@api private` have no signatures. CI validates the signatures (`rake rbs:validate`) and runs the suite under RBS's runtime type checker (`rake rbs:test`), so a signature that disagrees with the code fails the build. `CONTRIBUTING.md` explains how to keep `sig/` in step with API changes.

### Changed
- **Breaking: unknown keys on user-constructed types raise `ArgumentError`.** `.new` and `#[]=` on the value types you build and pass in (option values such as `AgentDefinition`, `SandboxSettings`, the thinking and MCP server configs; `HookMatcher`; hook outputs; `PermissionResultAllow` / `PermissionResultDeny`; `PermissionUpdate`; `PermissionRuleValue`) raise instead of warning, with a message naming the class, the key and the known keys: `ClaudeAgentSDK::HookMatcher: unknown attribute :matchr (known: hooks, matcher, timeout)`. camelCase and String keys and a type's own discriminator are still accepted; `.from_hash`, `.wrap` and every type parsed from CLI output stay lenient.
- **Breaking: `Type#[]`, `#[]=` and camelCase methods reach attributes only.** A name that is not an attribute behaves like an undefined one: `msg[:to_h]` is `nil`, `#[]=` ignores it (raises on the strict types above), `msg.toH` raises `NoMethodError` and `respond_to?(:toH)` is `false`. Methods your own code adds to a subclass, mixin or instance still count as attributes.
- **Breaking: store-backed resume failures raise `SessionStoreError` instead of `RuntimeError`.** The two SDK-raised `RuntimeError`s (store call failed, store call timed out) become `SessionStoreError`, and a `RuntimeError` raised by the adapter itself, which 0.37 let through unwrapped, is now wrapped too, so `rescue ClaudeSDKError` catches every resume-materialization failure. Code that rescued `RuntimeError` there must rescue `SessionStoreError`. The failure message now includes the adapter exception's class (`... failed during resume materialization: IOError: connection reset`).
- `UPGRADING-1.0.md` ships in the gem and the YARD docs, linked from the README.
- The deprecation warning printed by the ten `*_from_store` / `*_via_store` session functions, and their YARD and docs, now say they will be removed in **2.0**. 0.36 and 0.37 said 1.0, but they stay, deprecated, for all of 1.x ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)). Nothing else about them changes: each still works and still warns once per process.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-09-23

The last 0.x release before 1.0 ([roadmap](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)). No runtime behaviour changes — only new warnings for things 1.0 will reject. **Run your suite on 0.37 with warnings visible before moving to 1.0:**
- A misspelled key on a value type you build (`HookMatcher`, `AgentDefinition`, `SandboxSettings`, MCP server configs, permission results, hook outputs, …) now warns once, pointing at your call; 1.0 raises `ArgumentError`.
- `msg[:name]` / camelCase readers reaching a non-attribute method (e.g. `msg[:to_h]`) warn once; in 1.0 they only reach attributes.
- The 1.0 SemVer surface is now visible: SDK internals are tagged `@api private` and hidden from the API docs, and the documented contracts (Hash-key rule, `mcp_status` / `context_usage` return Hashes, `Type#[]`) are written down.

### Changed
- **Docs: pre-1.0 contracts written down** ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)). No code changes. `Client#mcp_status` / `#get_mcp_status` and `#context_usage` / `#get_context_usage` return the CLI's raw Hash with camelCase Symbol keys. `docs/types.md` had described `McpStatusResponse` as the response type; it is the optional typed view, via `McpStatusResponse.parse(client.mcp_status)`, and there is no typed context-usage class (`docs/client.md`). A new "Hash keys" section in `docs/types.md` states one rule: Hashes passed through from the live CLI stream (`origin`, `usage`, `model_usage`, hook `tool_input`, `can_use_tool` input, SDK MCP tool args, control responses) have Symbol keys spelled as on the wire, and Hashes read from transcripts or a `SessionStore` (`SessionMessage#message`, `get_subagent_metadata`, store keys and entries) have String keys. The docs, examples and bundled skill drop their `h[:key] || h['key']` fallbacks in favour of the one correct form. `Type#[]`, `#[]=` and the camelCase readers are documented as public API, including that `#[]=` changes the object you received. `docs/sessions.md` documents `ClaudeAgentSDK.project_key_for_directory` and `ClaudeAgentSDK.fold_session_summary` for adapter authors, and `import_session_to_store`'s batching (`batch_size:` defaults to 500 entries, and a batch also ends at about 1 MiB).
- **SDK internals are now tagged `@api private` and hidden from the YARD docs** ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)). The tagged namespaces are `Query`, `MessageParser`, `TranscriptMirrorBatcher`, `Sessions`, `SessionMutations`, `SessionResume`, `MaterializedResume`, `SessionSummary`, `SessionStores`, `OptionWarnings` and `FiberBoundary`, including everything nested in them. Some public classes also have internal members, and those are tagged individually: `SubprocessCLITransport`'s methods outside the `Transport` interface and its constants; `CommandBuilder`'s constants (`.new` and `#build` stay public); `CLIInstaller::Http`, `Platform`, `Release` and `Metadata` and the installer's constants other than `PINNED_CLI_VERSION`; `SdkMcpServer#handle_json`, `#handle_message` and `SdkMcpServer::ToolInputSchema`; `Client#query_handler`; and `ClaudeAgentSDK::OBSERVER_INTERFACE`. Their public faces are unchanged: `ClaudeAgentSDK.offload`, `fold_session_summary`, the session functions and `SDKSessionInfo` / `SessionMessage` remain public. Nothing changes at runtime. No method or constant was renamed, removed or made private, so every existing call keeps working. From 1.0, SemVer covers `docs/` and the YARD API without `@api private`; objects tagged `@api private` are not covered and may change in any release. `CONTRIBUTING.md` has a new "What is public API" section.
- `lib/claude_agent_sdk/types.rb` is split into one file per area under `lib/claude_agent_sdk/types/` (messages, hooks, options, ...). The code moved without edits and `types.rb` still loads every part, so `require 'claude_agent_sdk/types'` and every class and constant are unchanged; no API change ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)).
- `Type`'s internal machinery is tagged `@api private` and leaves the rendered docs: `Type#dup_for_options`, `Type.deep_dup_for_options`, `Type::OptionValue`, `Type.inspect_filtered`, `Type.inspect_filtered_attributes`, and the new `Type.strict_attributes` / `.strict_attributes?` / `.declare_attributes` / `.attribute?` / `.attribute_names`. They are not part of the SemVer surface. `Type#[]`, `#[]=`, the camelCase readers, `#to_h`, `.wrap` and `.from_hash` stay public ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)).

### Deprecated
- **Unknown keys on user-constructed types.** The value types you build and pass in (option values such as `AgentDefinition`, `SandboxSettings`, the thinking configs and the MCP server configs; `HookMatcher`; hook outputs; `PermissionResultAllow` / `PermissionResultDeny`; `PermissionUpdate`; `PermissionRuleValue`) silently dropped a misspelled key, so `HookMatcher.new(matchr: 'Bash')` quietly built a matcher with no `matcher` set. `.new` and `#[]=` now warn once per class and key, at the caller's line: `ClaudeAgentSDK::HookMatcher: unknown attribute :matchr ignored; this will raise ArgumentError in 1.0 (known: hooks, matcher, timeout)`. **In 1.0 they raise `ArgumentError`**, as `ClaudeAgentOptions` already does. camelCase and String keys and a type's own discriminator (`type`, `hook_event_name`, `behavior`) are accepted, so `klass.new(value.to_h)` round-trips silently. Types parsed from CLI output (messages, content blocks, hook inputs) and every construction through `.from_hash` / `.wrap` stay lenient, so a newer CLI's extra fields never warn; permission suggestions from the CLI are now hydrated through `PermissionUpdate.wrap` for that reason. Full list in `docs/types.md` ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)).
- **`Type#[]`, `#[]=` and camelCase methods reaching something other than an attribute.** They are public API for a type's attributes (its `attr_*` fields, the backward-compatible `RateLimitEvent#data`, predicates such as `options.forkSession?`, and any method your own code adds to a subclass, mixin or instance), but they resolved any public method: `msg[:to_h]` returned a Hash, `msg['freeze']` froze the message, `msg.toH` called `#to_h`. Such a call still works but warns once per class and name, e.g. `ClaudeAgentSDK::ResultMessage#[]: :to_h is not an attribute; Type#[] will only read attributes in 1.0`. **In 1.0 a name that is not an attribute behaves like an undefined one:** `#[]` returns `nil`, `#[]=` ignores it (raises on the types above), a camelCase call raises `NoMethodError`, and `respond_to?` says `false`. Names that are not methods at all keep today's behaviour and do not warn. `UserMessage#text` / `AssistantMessage#text` are convenience methods, not attributes ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)).

## [0.36.0] - 2026-09-23

The first step on the [road to 1.0](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126): one `session_store:` argument for every session function (the store-specific twins are deprecated), `ClaudeAgentSDK.ask`, String tool results, and the last audit follow-ups (#119–#121). **Read before upgrading:**
- An `exit`, `Interrupt` or signal raised inside a hook, `can_use_tool` or SDK MCP handler now **ends the process after the CLI gets its error response**. Since 0.34.0 a tool handler's `exit` was turned into an `isError` result and the process kept running, which also swallowed a real Ctrl-C or SIGTERM in `:inline` mode.
- The `*_from_store` / `*_via_store` session functions print a one-time deprecation warning; switch to `list_sessions(session_store: store)` etc. (table under **Deprecated**).
- Local-disk session APIs raise `ConfigDirError` (not `ArgumentError`) on hosts without a home directory; a session with no prompt has `first_prompt` `nil` on the disk path too (was `''`).

### Added
- **SDK MCP tool handlers may return a String.** `create_tool('greet', ...) { |args| "Hello, #{args[:name]}!" }` now sends Claude a single text block, the same as returning `{ content: [{ type: 'text', text: "Hello, ..." }] }`. Both dispatch paths (`tools/call` through the MCP server and the direct `SdkMcpServer#call_tool`) accept it. Hash returns behave exactly as before and remain the form for `is_error`, `structured_content`, images and several blocks; any other non-Hash return still produces the in-band "must return a hash with :content key" error. The `create_tool` YARD examples, README and `docs/mcp-servers.md` (new "Handler Return Values" section) lead with the String form.
- **`ClaudeAgentSDK.ask(prompt, options: nil)`** — runs `query` to completion and returns the final `ResultMessage`, so `ClaudeAgentSDK.ask("What is 2 + 2?").result` is the answer text, with cost, usage and `session_id` on the same object. It is `query` underneath: same prompt types (String or Enumerable), same `options:` and `transport:`, same errors (a terminal error exit still raises `ResultError`; an `is_error` result that is not followed by an error exit is returned like any other). An optional block receives every message as it arrives, so callers can stream progress and still get the result. It consumes the whole stream and returns the last `ResultMessage`; if the stream ends without one it raises `CLIConnectionError`. The README Quick Start now leads with it.
- **Ruby-style `Client` method names next to the Python-parity ones**: `client.model = 'haiku'` (`set_model`), `client.permission_mode = 'plan'` (`set_permission_mode`), `client.context_usage` (`get_context_usage`) and `client.mcp_status` (`get_mcp_status`). Each delegates to its parity counterpart, so both spellings send the same control request, raise the same `CLIConnectionError` before `connect`, and an override of the parity method covers both. The parity names stay, so code ported from the Python docs keeps working. (`server_info` / `get_server_info` already existed as a pair.) `docs/client.md` lists both spellings.
- **`CLIInstaller.root` — a configurable root for the vendored CLI.** `CLIInstaller.default_dir` (and so `install`, `install_pinned`, `installed_path` without `dir:`, and the transport's discovery of the vendored binary) is `vendor/claude` under `CLIInstaller.root` when it is set, and under the working directory at call time when it is `nil`, the default. A process whose cwd is not the project root, such as a daemonized worker, can now find the vendored binary instead of falling through to `PATH`. The setter takes a String or Pathname, absolutizes it once, and rejects an empty path; `nil` restores the working-directory default. Unset, nothing changes, and an explicit `dir:` still wins.
- **The Railtie anchors CLI discovery to `Rails.root`**: an initializer sets `CLIInstaller.root ||= Rails.root` before `config/initializers` run, so an app initializer can override it and a root set in `config/application.rb` is kept. The `claude_agent_sdk:install_cli` task, which does not boot the app, installs under an explicitly set `CLIInstaller.root` if there is one, and under `Rails.root/vendor/claude` as before otherwise. The generated initializer's commented `cli_path:` line no longer describes a cwd workaround. `docs/cli-installer.md` gains a "Where `vendor/claude` is" section.
Groundwork for 1.0 ([#126](https://github.com/rubycatco/claude-agent-sdk-ruby/issues/126)): the sessions API collapses to one function per operation, and the store-specific twins are deprecated. Nothing is removed; every existing call keeps working.
- **`session_store:` on every session function.** `list_sessions`, `get_session_info`, `get_session_messages`, `list_subagents`, `get_subagent_metadata`, `get_subagent_messages`, `rename_session`, `tag_session`, `delete_session` and `fork_session` take an optional `session_store:`. Omitted or `nil`, they work on local disk exactly as before; given a store, they run the same code the `*_from_store` / `*_via_store` function did, with the same arguments. Two differences between the paths are documented in `docs/sessions.md`: `directory: nil` means every project on disk but the current working directory with a store (a store cannot enumerate projects), and `include_worktrees:` is disk-only: with `session_store:`, `list_sessions` accepts only the default `true` and raises `ArgumentError` for `false` or `nil` instead of silently ignoring the filter.
- **`ClaudeAgentSDK::ConfigDirError`** (a `ClaudeSDKError`), raised by the local-disk session APIs when the Claude config directory cannot be located: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is unset and there is no usable home directory for the default `~/.claude`. Its message says to set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (#120).
- CI: a macOS leg (Ruby 3.4) for the main suite; simplecov coverage (`COVERAGE=1 bundle exec rspec`) on the Linux Ruby 3.4 leg, with line/branch totals in the job summary and the HTML report as an artifact; and a weekly real-CLI integration run (`.github/workflows/integration.yml`) against `CLIInstaller::PINNED_CLI_VERSION`, also triggered by PRs that touch the installer. Dependabot keeps the workflows' actions current.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and issue and pull request templates.

### Changed
- **`exit` / `Interrupt` / signal exceptions from an SDK MCP tool handler terminate the process again, after the CLI gets its `isError` result.** Since #77 (0.34.0) they were converted into an `isError` result and the process kept running. That also swallowed a real Ctrl-C or `SIGTERM` landing in an `:inline` handler. The `isError` text now names the exception class (`"SystemExit: exit"` rather than `"exit"`). `SdkMcpServer#call_tool` and `#handle_message`, called directly without a session, let these exceptions propagate instead of returning an `isError` result. (#119)
- **Root-module plumbing is tagged `@api private`** and no longer appears in the generated YARD docs (`.yardopts` gains `--hide-api private`; `--no-private` alone never hid `@api private` objects): `resolve_observers`, `extract_sdk_mcp_servers`, `convert_hooks_to_internal_format`, `configure_can_use_tool`, `extract_exclude_dynamic_sections`, `extract_system_prompt_snapshot`, `notify_observers`, `check_inline_isolation`, `extract_user_prompt_text`, `prompt_text_from_content`, `observing_prompt_stream`, `flexible_fetch`, `normalize_tool_result`, and the tool-schema helpers `deep_symbolize_keys`, `deep_normalize_schema`, `prebuilt_json_schema?`, `normalize_tool_schema`, `ruby_type_to_json_schema`. They still work, but they are not part of the public API and move under `ClaudeAgentSDK::Internal` in 1.0. `fold_session_summary` stays public, since SessionStore adapters call it from `#append`. The existing `@api private` tags (`FiberBoundary` internals, `CancellationSignal#cancel`) are hidden too; `#cancel`'s tag is moved to its own line, where YARD recognizes it.
- `examples/rails_actioncable_example.rb` and `examples/rails_background_job_example.rb` use `ClaudeAgentSDK::Client.open` instead of hand-rolled `Async { connect … ensure disconnect }.wait`, matching `docs/rails.md`.
- RuboCop targets Ruby 3.2, the gemspec floor (was 3.0). The resulting autocorrections (anonymous block forwarding, dropping `require 'set'`) change no behavior.

### Deprecated
- **The ten store-specific session functions**, removed in 1.0. Each still returns exactly what it did before (a `nil` `session_store:` still fails rather than falling back to disk), and prints a one-time warning per method per process naming its replacement and the calling line, e.g. `app/jobs/sync.rb:12: warning: ClaudeAgentSDK.list_sessions_from_store is deprecated and will be removed in 1.0; use ClaudeAgentSDK.list_sessions(session_store: store)`. The warning uses plain `Kernel#warn`, not `category: :deprecated`, because Ruby hides that category unless `Warning[:deprecated]` is enabled; `-W0` / `$VERBOSE = nil` silences it.

  | Deprecated | Replacement |
  |---|---|
  | `list_sessions_from_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `list_sessions(session_store: s, ...)` |
  | `get_session_info_from_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `get_session_info(session_store: s, ...)` |
  | `get_session_messages_from_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `get_session_messages(session_store: s, ...)` |
  | `list_subagents_from_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `list_subagents(session_store: s, ...)` |
  | `get_subagent_metadata_from_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `get_subagent_metadata(session_store: s, ...)` |
  | `get_subagent_messages_from_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `get_subagent_messages(session_store: s, ...)` |
  | `rename_session_via_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `rename_session(session_store: s, ...)` |
  | `tag_session_via_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `tag_session(session_store: s, ...)` |
  | `delete_session_via_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `delete_session(session_store: s, ...)` |
  | `fork_session_via_store(session_store: s, ...)` | `fork_session(session_store: s, ...)` |

  All other arguments carry over unchanged. `import_session_to_store` is not affected.

### Fixed
- **`exit`, `Interrupt` and signal exceptions raised while a hook, `can_use_tool`, or an SDK MCP resource reader / prompt generator runs no longer leave the CLI without an answer.** The SDK now responds first, then re-raises. The CLI gets exactly the response an ordinary exception from that callback produces, naming the exception class (`"SystemExit: exit"`, `"Interrupt"`, `"SignalException: SIGTERM"`). For hooks and `can_use_tool` that is the error control response; for `resources/read` / `prompts/get` it is a JSON-RPC `-32603` error. The transport flushes that response, and then the original exception propagates, so the process terminates as plain Ruby would: `exit 3` exits with status 3, and Ctrl-C interrupts. Previously no response was written and the reactor stopped. In the default `:thread` scheduling, Ruby also re-raised the worker thread's `SystemExit` on the main thread, which answered with a misleading `Cancelled`. This covers every dispatch site: `can_use_tool`, hooks with and without a `HookMatcher#timeout` (both variants), resources, prompts and tool handlers. It also covers a real Ctrl-C / `SIGTERM` that MRI delivers to the main thread while an `:inline` callback runs there, and a `:thread` hook that calls `exit` after its timeout expired (only `exit` is carried out of such an abandoned worker: an `Interrupt` or signal exception it raises ends that thread alone, as in plain Ruby). Cancellation (`Async::Stop`, hook timeouts) still propagates unchanged. A `callback_wrapper` sees an internal `StandardError` carrier whose `#cause` is the original, so ensure-based wrappers still clean up; the original is re-raised even if the wrapper swallows the carrier. Observers and message blocks are unchanged. (#119)
- **Session APIs on hosts without a home directory (#120).** With `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` unset and `HOME` unset with no passwd entry (`docker --user` in a minimal image) or an empty/relative `HOME`:
  - the local-disk session APIs (`list_sessions`, `get_session_*`, `list_subagents`, `rename_session` / `tag_session` / `delete_session` / `fork_session`, `import_session_to_store`) raise `ConfigDirError` instead of a bare `ArgumentError` from `~` expansion;
  - a fresh session with a `session_store` no longer fails at connect. The transcript mirror cannot map the CLI's transcript files to store keys without a projects dir, so each unmappable batch is reported as a `MirrorErrorMessage` (with a `nil` key) and counted as dropped, while the session itself runs normally. `SessionStores.projects_dir` returns `nil` in this case instead of raising.
- **Store-backed resume seeds auth and settings from the home the CLI subprocess will use (#120).** When `options.env` sets `HOME`, `.credentials.json`, `settings.json` / `cowork_settings.json` and `.claude.json` are now read from under that home, as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` already was, instead of the parent process's home. An empty or relative `HOME` there, or `HOME => nil`, counts as no home, so those files are skipped. The transcript mirror resolves the subprocess's default `~/.claude/projects` the same way, so a `HOME` override no longer sends every mirror frame down the "not under projects dir" drop path.
- **Remaining disk/store session read inconsistencies (#121):**
  - Store listings report `SDKSessionInfo#last_modified` as Integer epoch milliseconds, as documented, whatever shape the adapter's `mtime` has (ISO-8601 String, numeric String, Float, or now `Time`, e.g. an ActiveRecord `updated_at`). Previously only the ordering was coerced and the raw value leaked through. An unusable mtime (including non-finite numbers) reads as `0`, the value it already sorted by.
  - `continue_conversation` with a `session_store` breaks equal-mtime ties by `session_id`, like the listings, instead of resuming whichever session the adapter listed first.
  - `first_prompt` is `nil` on the disk path too (it was `''`) when a session has no prompt, matching the store path and the Python SDK.
  - `cwd`: both paths take the first non-blank top-level `cwd`. The disk path took the first `cwd` even when empty (then fell back to the project path) and also matched `cwd` keys nested in tool inputs; the store fold now also skips whitespace-only values, so a sidecar no longer locks on one.
  - `rename_session` / `tag_session` / `delete_session` / `fork_session` and their `_via_store` counterparts validate `session_id` (and `up_to_message_id`) at the boundary like the readers: a non-String id raises `ArgumentError` ("Invalid session_id") instead of `NoMethodError`.
  - `list_sessions` deduplicates a session found in several project directories deterministically: newest `last_modified`, then the larger file, then the project directory that sorts first (the global scan now walks project directories in name order). Equal mtimes used to keep whichever copy the filesystem listed first.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-09-23

First-class Rails integration and a first-impressions pass. **Rails users:** if your initializer uses the previously documented `->(inv) { Rails.application.executor.wrap { inv.call } }` callback wrapper, switch to `ClaudeAgentSDK::Railtie.callback_wrapper` — the bare form can deadlock in development (see **Fixed**).

### Added
- **Rails integration: `ClaudeAgentSDK::Railtie`**, loaded only when Rails is (`require_relative 'claude_agent_sdk/railtie' if defined?(Rails::Railtie)`, which Bundler.require satisfies in a Rails app); non-Rails processes load nothing new. It contributes a rake task and installs nothing into callback dispatch.
- **`bin/rails generate claude_agent_sdk:install`** — writes `config/initializers/claude_agent_sdk.rb` (commented `model` / `permission_mode` / `cli_path` / OpenTelemetry defaults, `callback_wrapper: ClaudeAgentSDK::Railtie.callback_wrapper` enabled), appends `/vendor/claude/` to `.gitignore` once (any existing spelling counts), and prints the next steps.
- **`claude_agent_sdk:install_cli` rake task** — `CLIInstaller.install_pinned` into `Rails.root/vendor/claude`, or `install(version:)` with `CLAUDE_CLI_VERSION=x.y.z|stable|latest`; prints the installed path. It does not boot the app, so it runs in a Docker build step. Outside Rails, `require 'claude_agent_sdk/tasks'` in a Rakefile provides the same task (loading only `CLIInstaller`), installing under the working directory.
- **`ClaudeAgentSDK::Railtie.callback_wrapper`** — a `callback_wrapper` that runs SDK callbacks in `Rails.application.executor` (so ActiveRecord connections check back in), except where that deadlocks: with code reloading enabled or `config.allow_concurrency = false` it calls the callback outside the executor and releases the thread's ActiveRecord connections itself; when the executor is already active on the callback's context (`:inline` scheduling) it calls straight through. Supports Rails 7.1+.
- CI: a `rails` job runs the Rails integration specs (`spec/rails`, in their own process via `rspec --options spec/rails/.rspec`) against Rails 7.1 on Ruby 3.2 and the latest Rails 8 on Ruby 3.4 (`gemfiles/rails_7_1.gemfile`, `gemfiles/rails_8.gemfile`). The default `bundle exec rspec` run excludes `spec/rails`.
- **Every SDK type now prints its fields.** `Type#inspect` lists the non-nil attributes (`#<ClaudeAgentSDK::ResultMessage subtype="success" num_turns=3 total_cost_usd=0.012 ...>`) instead of a bare object address, and `#to_s` falls back to it, so the README's `puts message` is readable for every message type. The output is bounded for logging: Strings past 80 characters are truncated with a count of what was cut, Arrays and Hashes show their first five entries plus a count of the rest, nesting past two levels (and any reference cycle) collapses to a placeholder, and objects that only have `Kernel#inspect` (SDK MCP server instances, store adapters, observers) show as `#<ClassName>` rather than dumping their state. Callbacks (`can_use_tool`, hooks, `callback_wrapper`, ...) render from their source location, e.g. `#<Proc(lambda) permissions.rb:17>`, never through their own `#inspect`, so a raising or oversized override cannot break or flood a log line.
- **One-line `to_s` for results and system messages.** `ResultMessage#to_s` prints `[result: success, 3 turns, 4.2s, $0.0120]` (missing fields omitted; an error result appends its `errors`), `SystemMessage#to_s` prints `[system: init]`, and `TextBlock#to_s` returns its text. `UserMessage` / `AssistantMessage` keep printing their text.

### Changed
- `docs/rails.md` opens with a getting-started path (gem → generator → `install_cli` → first job), and its ActionCable, session-resumption and background-job examples use `ClaudeAgentSDK::Client.open` instead of hand-rolled `Async { connect … ensure disconnect }.wait`. README and gemspec description lead with the Rails integration.
- **`#inspect` filters credential-bearing attributes** to `"[FILTERED]"` (Hash keys stay visible): `ClaudeAgentOptions#env` (usually carries `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), `McpStdioServerConfig#env`, and `McpHttpServerConfig` / `McpSSEServerConfig#headers`, since these objects end up in logs. The objects are not modified. Type subclasses declare such attributes with `inspect_filtered :name`. Typed `SystemMessage` subclasses (`InitMessage`, ...) leave the raw `@data` frame out of `#inspect`, since it repeats their attributes; a bare `SystemMessage` keeps it. Nothing sent to the CLI changes: wire output still goes through `#to_h`.
- The README's `Client` section and the basic example in `docs/client.md` now lead with `Client.open`, which creates the reactor and always disconnects, instead of the `Async do … begin … ensure client.disconnect end.wait` boilerplate. The manual `connect` / `disconnect` form is still shown for code already running inside an `Async` reactor. No API changes.
- The bundled `claude-agent-ruby` skill recommends `Client.open` and documents the install generator, the `install_cli` task and `Railtie.callback_wrapper`.
- **Gem metadata names its maintainer** (`authors: ["ya-luotao"]`, with a contact email) instead of "Community Contributors". The stale `IMPLEMENTATION.md` is removed, and the past audit reports move from the repository root to `docs/history/`, which is not packaged with the gem.

### Fixed
- **The Rails `callback_wrapper` previously recommended in docs/rails.md, `->(inv) { Rails.application.executor.wrap { inv.call } }`, can deadlock in development.** With code reloading enabled, the request or job calling the SDK holds a share of the reload interlock while it waits for a callback running on its own thread (the default `:thread` scheduling); if a reload is requested meanwhile — e.g. after the agent edits an app file — the reloader queues for the exclusive lock and the callback's `executor.wrap` queues behind it, forever. With `config.allow_concurrency = false` the same wrapper blocks on the executor's monitor every time. The guide (and the `callback_wrapper` API docs and skill reference) now recommend `ClaudeAgentSDK::Railtie.callback_wrapper`; replace the bare lambda with it in existing initializers.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-09-23

The September 2026 audit campaign: 17 fixes from the final audit pass plus the 28 AUDIT-2026-09-22 issues (#66–#93). A few fixes tighten behaviour that was silently wrong — read **Changed** before upgrading.

### Added
- **`CLIInstaller::PINNED_CLI_VERSION`** (`'2.1.280'`, the CLI Python SDK 0.2.158 bundles) — the CLI version this gem release is developed and tested against; the Ruby equivalent of the Python SDK's bundled-CLI pin (`_cli_version.py`), except nothing is shipped inside the gem. Single source of truth: this constant is the only place the pin lives — docs and the transport's guidance reference it rather than repeating the literal.
- **`CLIInstaller.install_pinned(dir: nil)`** — installs exactly `PINNED_CLI_VERSION`. The Dockerfile / `bin/setup` form of "pin the tested pair": a deploy that calls it gets the SDK+CLI combination this release was tested with, and a Dependabot bump of the gem carries the CLI forward with it — no version literal in the caller to keep in sync. `install`'s default is unchanged (`'stable'` dist-tag), and explicit `version:` pins behave exactly as before.
- **`.github/workflows/cli-pin-bump.yml`** — scheduled (and manually dispatchable) workflow that reads the Python SDK's `_cli_version.py` on `main` and opens a PR moving `PINNED_CLI_VERSION` when it changes. It touches only that one line; cutting the follow-up patch release stays a human decision.

### Changed
- **Runtime dependency floors now name versions that actually work: `async >= 2.10, < 3` and `mcp >= 0.22, < 2`** (were `~> 2.0` / `>= 0.20`). A new CI leg runs the suite against exactly these floors: async 2.0.x cannot run on Ruby 3.2+ at all, releases before 2.6.4 break hook timeouts and control-request error delivery, and 2.10 is the first with `Task#defer_stop`, which `Query#close` now relies on. `mcp` 0.20/0.21 fail every `tools/call` of a tool whose schema uses `$ref` into `$defs`. Only bundles pinned below these floors are affected. (#87)
- **`config.default_options = {...}` stores a frozen deep copy.** Change defaults by assigning a new Hash; in-place mutation of the stored defaults (`config.default_options[:model] = 'x'`, `merge!`, including on the initial empty Hash) now raises `FrozenError`, and later changes to the Hash you passed have no effect. The snapshot's Strings are frozen too: a session built from configured defaults shares them, so reassign (`options.model = 'opus'`) rather than mutate in place. Your own Hash and objects, and identity-bearing values such as SDK MCP server instances, are never frozen. (#92)
- **`rename_session_via_store` / `tag_session_via_store` raise `Errno::ENOENT` for a session the store has never seen** (`#load` returns nil or `[]`), like their disk counterparts and `fork_session_via_store`, instead of appending — and so creating — a phantom session that could never be deleted on append-only stores. Deliberately stricter than the Python SDK's store helpers. (#85)
- **`exit`, `Interrupt` and signal exceptions raised inside an SDK MCP tool handler are reported in-band** as an `isError: true` result, so the `tools/call` control response is always written; previously they escaped dispatch (and in the default `:thread` scheduling `exit` tore down the session). Cancellation still propagates. A `callback_wrapper` now observes a `RuntimeError` whose `#cause` is the original exception. Hooks and `can_use_tool` are tracked in #119. (#77)
- **Transcript mirror `eager` mode no longer guarantees one `SessionStore#append` per frame.** At most one background drain runs at a time; frames arriving while an append is in flight are coalesced, in order, into the next one (see Fixed, #84). Adapters must not assume one frame per call.
- **Subagent readers only accept `agent_id`s matching `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`** (never `.` or `..`); anything else returns `[]` / `nil` without calling the adapter, so a path- or prefix-keyed `SessionStore` can't be re-routed through the synthesized `subagents/agent-<agent_id>` subpath (now documented in the adapter contract). (#79)
- **Blank session metadata reads the same on disk and in a store:** whitespace-only `git_branch` / `tag` are `nil` and a blank `cwd` falls back to the project path on the disk path too. (#67)
- **S3 reference adapter (`examples/session_stores/s3_session_store.rb`)** reserves each part number through a per-transcript `.sequence` object with conditional writes, so appends stay ordered across adapter instances and clock skew. Requires an S3-compatible endpoint with strong consistency and conditional `PUT`; stop old writers before upgrading (mixed old/new writers are unsupported), and quiesce writers before deleting sessions. Each uncontended append costs two extra requests.
- **`CLIInstaller`'s `VERSION` file records the target platform** (OS, architecture, libc) alongside version and checksum, and the offline shortcut requires all three to match, so a cache copied from another platform is reinstalled instead of trusted. Older one- or two-line metadata needs one online reinstall, then works offline again.
- **SDK MCP servers reject a tool whose input schema declares a top-level `server_context` property** at registration (the `mcp` gem would silently overwrite it with its own context), and a call that passes one to a composed/referenced/free-form schema gets an actionable `isError` result without invoking the handler.
- The transport's "Claude Code not found" guidance, `docs/cli-installer.md` and the skill references now point at `install_pinned` (interpolating the constant) instead of a hardcoded example version that went stale with every CLI release.
- Docs, examples and the bundled `claude-agent-ruby` skill now use current model IDs (`claude-opus-5`, `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`) and recommend adaptive thinking plus `effort:`; `ThinkingConfigEnabled(budget_tokens:)` is described as the older-model path. `examples/extended_thinking_example.rb` no longer teaches the deprecated `max_thinking_tokens`. No API changes.

### Fixed

**Subprocess transport and teardown**
- **A stdin write cancelled mid-frame now poisons the transport instead of corrupting the session.** An `Async::Stop`, inline cooperative timeout or deadline landing while a large frame was parked on a full pipe left `ready?` true, so the next frame was appended to the partial one and every later message was invalid JSON. The original cancellation still propagates; every later write raises `CLIConnectionError` ("possible partial frame"). Recovery is a new session. (#80)
- **`close` and `end_input` no longer hang or strand a writer parked on a full stdin pipe.** A reactor fiber parked in the write is woken with the documented `CLIConnectionError`, and on Ruby 3.3+ a reactor-side close no longer hangs the whole reactor while a FiberBoundary worker thread is parked in the write. (#80)
- **`read_messages` no longer waits forever for a CLI that closes stdout and then hangs.** After stdout EOF the SDK waits 5 s, then TERM, then KILL, and raises `ProcessError` ("did not exit within 5s of closing stdout", negative-signal `exit_code`). (#73)
- **A truncated final stdout frame is reported** as `CLIJSONDecodeError` (`line` holds the partial frame) instead of the stream silently ending without its `ResultMessage`. Whitespace-only tails and reads cut short by `close` stay silent. (#89)
- **`Client#disconnect` called from inside an inline control-request callback, or from a streaming-input enumerator, now finishes the teardown before the caller unwinds.** The callback's task belongs to the tree the close stops, and the cascading `Async::Stop` used to interrupt `Query#close` before the transport and the close watcher were closed (a bare `Query#close` leaked the CLI process). The stop is now deferred through the teardown; the caller then unwinds with `Async::Stop` (use `ensure`, not `rescue StandardError`). A teardown error superseded by that Stop is warned on stderr. `:thread` mode, message blocks and observers are unchanged: `disconnect` returns normally there. (#81)
- **An outer `Async` timeout during `close` no longer makes the transport forget a still-live CLI process**: the timeout propagates and the TERM/KILL fallback keeps ownership. A cancelled close's background fallback releases the process from the at-exit registry only once it has actually been reaped.
- **Control requests fail promptly when the stream ends**: a clean read EOF broadcasts a terminal error to every waiting control request (they used to sit out the 1200 s timeout), and requests issued after EOF are rejected before writing. A control request's serialization, write and wait now share one deadline and one cleanup scope, so a failed or cancelled send never leaks its waiter and backpressure can't block past the configured timeout.
- **CLI stderr is scrubbed to valid UTF-8** for the `stderr` callback, `debug_stderr` and `ProcessError#stderr`, like stdout frames. (#90)
- **CLI discovery no longer accepts a non-executable file at a well-known install location** — a stray 0644 `~/.claude/local/claude` now ends in `CLINotFoundError` with install instructions instead of a raw `Errno::EACCES` at spawn. (#72)
- **Store-backed resume and CLI discovery work on hosts without a usable home directory** (`HOME` unset with no passwd entry, e.g. `docker --user` in a minimal image, or an empty/relative `HOME`): home-relative auth seeds and install locations are skipped instead of raising `ArgumentError`. `Sessions.config_dir` / `projects_dir` are tracked in #120. (#82)
- **Sandbox settings merging resolves a relative settings file against the CLI's `cwd`**, not the Ruby process's working directory.
- **`FiberBoundary` worker threads disable `report_on_exception` before the callback runs**, so a fast-failing callback is no longer also dumped to stderr. (#93)

**Options and configuration**
- **Typed option values are no longer shared by reference between sessions.** `SandboxSettings` (and its network/filesystem configs), `SystemPromptPreset` / `Custom` / `File`, `ToolsPreset`, `AgentDefinition`, `HookMatcher`, thinking configs, `TaskBudget`, `Mcp*ServerConfig` and `SdkPluginConfig` placed in `ClaudeAgentSDK.configure` defaults, or copied by `ClaudeAgentOptions#dup_with` (including values nested in `agents`, `hooks`, `mcp_servers`, `plugins`), are copied per instance via the new `Type#dup_for_options` hook — a per-session change to sandbox rules or a system prompt can no longer silently change what every other session sends to the CLI. Unfrozen Strings are copied too. Procs, observers and factories, SDK MCP server instances, session-store adapters and `callback_wrapper` keep their identity; CLI arguments are unchanged. (#69, #70)
- **`Configuration#default_options` is no longer a live Hash read without synchronization**: request-time merges read a private frozen snapshot, so a concurrent in-place write can no longer raise `can't add a new key into hash during iteration` or tear a merge. (#92)
- **String-keyed SDK MCP server configs are recognized** (`{ 'tools' => { 'type' => 'sdk', 'instance' => server } }`, and `type: :sdk`): the instance is registered in-process, stdin stays open for its tool calls, and it is never serialized into `--mcp-config`. (#68)
- **`Client` normalizes input like `query()`**: a bare Hash prompt is rejected before anything is spawned (it used to stream Ruby inspection strings), and `nil` / empty hook lists are accepted instead of crashing `connect`.
- **Class-valued shorthand tool schemas work**: the documented `{ id: Integer }` advertises and accepts an integer (it advertised a string and rejected integers); `Float`, `TrueClass` and `FalseClass` likewise.
- **`ResultError`'s message and `#api_error_status` share one Integer narrowing**, so a non-Integer status (e.g. `"500"`) no longer appears as `API error (HTTP 500)` while the accessor returns `nil`. (#76)

**Sessions and SessionStore**
- **A single unserializable store entry no longer aborts a store-backed resume.** Entries (and subagent metadata sidecars) that JSON can't encode — NaN/Infinity, invalid UTF-8, circular or over-deep nesting — are skipped with a warning naming the entry's `uuid`; well-formed entries are written byte-for-byte as before. A session with no usable entries behaves like an empty one, and `--continue` classifies sidechains from the first surviving entry. (#83)
- **Non-String subkeys from a `SessionStore` are rejected** like any other unsafe subkey instead of raising `NoMethodError` and aborting the resume. (#91)
- **Store-backed listings coerce adapter `mtime` values** (ISO-8601 or numeric strings, e.g. SQL timestamps through JSON): they list newest first — they came back oldest first, so `limit:` cut off the newest sessions — and mixed Integer/String mtimes no longer raise. (#66)
- **Session listings break equal-mtime ties by `session_id`**, so `offset:` / `limit:` pages are stable across calls and never skip or repeat sessions, and disk and store listings order identical input identically. (#78)
- **Disk and store paths agree on sidechain classification and blank summaries**: a corrupt, blank, non-object or invalidly encoded first transcript line no longer makes one path list a session the other hides (the disk reader now classifies from the first parseable entry, as the store path did), and whitespace-only (or invalidly encoded) summaries/titles are blank on both. (#67, #75)
- **Session read APIs validate ids at the boundary**: a non-String or invalidly encoded `session_id` / `agent_id` gets the same `nil` / `[]` as a malformed id (and `import_session_to_store` raises `ArgumentError`) instead of a deep `NoMethodError` / `ArgumentError`. (#74)
- **The transcript mirror no longer piles up background tasks when the `SessionStore` is slower than the CLI's frame rate**: at most one drain task runs, and later frames are buffered and coalesced in order, without ever slowing the read loop. (#84)
- **Rename and tag no longer corrupt a transcript whose last record lacks a trailing newline**: the metadata record is written on its own line.
- **Forked sessions are published atomically**: the fork is written to a private temporary file and hard-linked into place, so a failed fork never leaves a partial session under its final id (filesystems without hard links fail safely).
- **An explicitly cleared custom or AI title at the end of a long transcript stays cleared** on the disk path (it resurrected an older title from the file head).
- **`InMemorySessionStore` deep-copies entries and summaries** across `append` / `load` / summary boundaries, so callers can no longer mutate stored transcripts through the objects they passed in or got back.
- **The SessionStore conformance kit checks summary content** (latest title, first timestamp, first prompt, sidechain classification across appends and refolds), so an adapter returning empty or stale summaries now fails it.
- Docs and the bundled skill describe what store-backed resume really seeds (`settings.json` / `cowork_settings.json` included since 0.31). (#86)

**Observability**
- **`OTelObserver` records per-turn cost increments** for `gen_ai.usage.cost` / `llm.cost.total`; the CLI reports cumulative `total_cost_usd`, so summing spans used to double-count earlier turns.
- **OpenTelemetry parent context is preserved across the SDK's fibers and threads** (`query()` / `Client.open` reactors, Query's background tasks, FiberBoundary worker dispatch), so observer and callback spans attach to the caller's trace instead of starting detached.

**Examples and tooling**
- `examples/error_handling_example.rb`'s retry helper now retries what the SDK raises: `ResultError` only for transient API statuses (429, 529, other 5xx), then bare `ProcessError` with bounded backoff. (#88)
- CI runs the suite against the newest allowed majors (json 3.x, mcp 1.x) and the declared dependency floors. The git-less gemspec fallback packages the same files git would; `docs/errors.md` lists `ResultError`; flaky ordering sleeps in specs are gone. (#87, #93)

## [0.33.1] - 2026-09-21

Compatibility with `json` 3.x and `mcp` 1.x. Upgrade if your bundle resolves `json` 3.x — `rename_session` / `tag_session` raise on 0.33.0.

### Changed
- `mcp` dependency is now `>= 0.20, < 2` (was `>= 0.6, < 1`). The floor moves to 0.20 because `mcp` 0.19 and older validate through the `json-schema` gem, which breaks under `json` 3.x and fails every SDK MCP `tools/call`; with `json` 2.x those versions still pass, so this only forces an `mcp` upgrade on bundles pinned below 0.20. The suite passes against every 1.x release through 1.6.0, and `initialize` / `tools/list` / `tools/call` / `resources/*` / `prompts/*` wire output is byte-identical to 0.2x.
- SDK MCP tool handler exceptions now reach the model as the bare exception message (matching Python's `str(e)` and `SdkMcpServer#call_tool`) instead of the gem's `Internal error calling tool X: msg`. The exception is rescued inside the SDK's tool class, so the text no longer depends on the `mcp` gem version — `mcp` 1.2+ redacts the message from its own wrapper, which would otherwise have left the model with no error text to self-correct from. Still in-band `isError: true`.

### Fixed
- `rename_session` / `tag_session` raised `ArgumentError: unknown keyword: space_size` under `json` 3.x, which takes generator options as strict keywords. The option was a no-op on `json` 2.x (output unchanged), so it is simply gone. A fresh end-user bundle resolves `json` 3.x through `async → console → json`; CI missed it only because the dev-only RuboCop pin holds `json` at 2.x.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-09-21

Subagent capabilities for UI builders: metadata reads, background snapshots, cooperative callback cancellation, and the task/background/permission signals the CLI already emits — all raw data and controls, no status model. Ruby-ahead of the Python SDK (0.2.153).

### Added
- `get_subagent_metadata` / `get_subagent_metadata_from_store`: read optional subagent metadata with original string keys, including type, spawning tool ID, parent agent, depth, and future CLI fields. Disk reads reuse transcript scoping without parsing the transcript; store reads select the latest metadata entry even before messages arrive. These are historical reads, not live-status queries.
- `background_tasks` and `session_crons` on `StopHookInput` / `SubagentStopHookInput`. Raw snapshots preserve unavailable (`nil`) versus explicitly empty (`[]`) and describe the parent session, not all foreground/background agents.
- Cooperative permission cancellation through `ToolPermissionContext#signal` (`CancellationSignal#cancelled?` / `#wait`) and the associated `request_id`. CLI cancellation, disconnect, EOF, and failed dispatch invalidate pending requests, including callbacks running on worker threads; normal decisions do not. User threads are not forcibly stopped, and late decisions after observed cancellation cannot become allow responses.
- `HookContext#signal` / `#request_id` use the same per-invocation cancellation contract, including hook timeouts. Thread callbacks can cooperate with cancellation; late hook output is discarded.
- A minimal subagent event subscription example and capability reference covering lifecycle events, metadata, background snapshots, and permission cancellation. UI and application status aggregation remain outside the SDK.
- Opt-in real-CLI subagent contract tests for ID/metadata/text correlation, permission cancellation on interrupt, and background completion/stop after a parent result. They self-skip without CLI credentials.
- Subagent UI signals the CLI already emits, read from the schema embedded in Claude Code CLI 2.1.278 (the Python SDK has none of these as of Python SDK 0.2.153; only partly verified live — a smoke run against CLI 2.1.278 confirmed the `task_started` fields and the targeted-miss `background_tasks` response; the rest is schema-derived). The SDK exposes raw data and controls only — no status aggregation.
  - `TaskStartedMessage#subagent_type` / `#is_backgrounded` / `#spawn_depth`, `TaskProgressMessage#subagent_type`, `TaskNotificationMessage#reason` / `#resource_links` (raw Array, symbol keys with the wire spelling), the `#skip_transcript` / `#ambient` display flags on both `TaskStartedMessage` and `TaskNotificationMessage` (hints for the host — the SDK never filters frames or computes activity), and `TaskUpdatedMessage#is_backgrounded` / `#error` / `#end_time` / `#total_paused_ms` / `#description` derived from `patch` like `status`. `is_backgrounded` keeps `nil` (not reported) distinct from an explicit `false` (foreground, spawning tool call blocking). `TaskUpdatedMessage` now also reads a string-keyed `patch` on hand-built messages.
  - `BackgroundTasksChangedMessage` (`background_tasks_changed`): the full set of live background tasks, a level signal with REPLACE semantics. The SDK's own stdin-close bookkeeping still deliberately ignores this frame.
  - `PermissionDeniedMessage` (`permission_denied`): a tool call auto-denied without an interactive prompt, with `agent_id` for subagent routing (not a permission `request_id`). A best-effort advisory, not a complete denial feed — `ResultMessage#permission_denials` stays authoritative.
  - `Client#background_tasks(tool_use_id: nil)` / `Query#background_tasks`: send in-flight foreground tasks to the background (Ctrl+B). Keyed by the spawning `tool_use_id`, not `task_id` / `agent_id`. The targeted form returns `{ backgrounded: true }` or `{ backgrounded: false }` — a definitive miss, after which no event is coming; `nil` is the explicit all-tasks form and returns `{}`. Because the CLI treats `''` as "all tasks", anything other than `nil` or a non-empty String raises `ArgumentError` before a request is written. `TaskUpdatedMessage#is_backgrounded` / `BackgroundTasksChangedMessage` report the lifecycle state that follows.
  - `ClaudeAgentOptions#agent_progress_summaries`: request model-generated progress summaries for subagents; `TaskProgressMessage#summary` may then be present, and stays optional. Tri-state; `nil` omits `agentProgressSummaries` from the `initialize` request and `true` / `false` are forwarded verbatim. An enable switch, not a live toggle: CLI 2.1.278 only acts on a truthy value, so `false` is equivalent to unset.
  - **Compatibility:** `background_tasks_changed` and `permission_denied` frames previously parsed as a generic `SystemMessage`. Both new classes subclass it, so `when SystemMessage` and `#data` consumers are unaffected; code matching on `message.class == SystemMessage` will no longer see them.

### Fixed
- Best-effort control error/cancellation replies no longer leak a secondary connection error when the CLI has already exited. Original transport read errors still propagate to the consumer.
- Control-request tracking is identity-guarded: if the CLI ever reused an in-flight request ID, the first handler finishing no longer untracks the later request's cancellation signal or task, so EOF, disconnect, and `control_cancel_request` still invalidate it and its late decision cannot be sent as a success.
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.configure` defaults now merge by option, not by literal key spelling. `ClaudeAgentOptions` accepts symbol/string and snake_case/camelCase names, but the defaults merge compared raw keys, so a differently spelled per-call key rode along as a second entry: `'permissionMode' => nil` wiped a configured `permission_mode:` instead of inheriting it, and a Hash option such as `'env' => {...}` replaced the configured `env:` instead of merging into it. Unknown option names are still reported with the caller's own spelling.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-09-17

Syncs the gem with Python SDK **0.2.153** (previously 0.2.147). The intervening Python releases 0.2.148–0.2.152 only bump the CLI binary Python bundles; this gem does not vendor a CLI, so they carry no Ruby-side change.

### Added
- **`snapshot` on `SystemPromptPreset`, and a new `SystemPromptCustom` type** (port of Python [#1268](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1268), v0.2.153). By default the CLI records the system prompt on a session's first request and reuses it on every later request, including after resume, so a changed `append` or custom prompt has no effect until the session is compacted or a new one starts. `snapshot: false` makes the CLI rebuild the prompt on every request instead — useful while iterating on prompt text across calls that resume the same session. `SystemPromptCustom` (`prompt:`, `snapshot:`) is the object form of a String prompt, so `snapshot` can travel with it; the `{ type: 'custom', prompt: '...', snapshot: false }` and `{ type: 'preset', ..., snapshot: false }` Hash forms are accepted too. The value rides on the control-protocol `initialize` request as `systemPromptSnapshot` (never as a CLI flag), so it applies to both `query()` and `Client`; `false` is sent explicitly and only an unset value is omitted. `SystemPromptFile` has no `snapshot`, and one given on a file Hash is ignored, as in Python. Requires Claude Code CLI 2.1.257 or later; before 2.1.265 a session with an `append` or custom prompt recorded it only when `snapshot` was `true`. Older CLIs silently ignore the field.
  - **Compatibility:** a `{ type: 'custom', ... }` Hash previously fell through the command builder unrecognised — pushing no flag at all — and so silently activated the *default* Claude Code system prompt. It now forwards `--system-prompt <prompt>` exactly like a String, and a custom prompt without a String `prompt` raises `ArgumentError` at command-build time rather than falling through (Python raises `KeyError` on the same input).

## [0.31.0] - 2026-08-28

Syncs the gem with Python SDK **0.2.147** (previously 0.2.134). The intervening Python releases 0.2.135/136/138/139/141–147 only bump the CLI binary Python bundles; this gem does not vendor a CLI, so they carry no Ruby-side change.

### Added
- **`ConversationResetMessage`** (port of Python [#1196](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1196), v0.2.137). The CLI announces a mid-session transcript discard (`/clear`, and any other flow that replaces the conversation without ending the connection) with a top-level `conversation_reset` frame. It was previously dropped by the parser's forward-compatibility fallthrough, so applications never saw resets — including ones they did not initiate. Carries `new_conversation_id`, `uuid` and `session_id`. A reset also **zeroes the running totals** on subsequent `ResultMessage`s (`total_cost_usd` and friends), so snapshot them when this arrives. `new_conversation_id` is not the next `session_id`; read that from the following message.
  - **Compatibility:** this widens the `Message` union with a frame that was previously dropped silently. Code that raises on an unrecognized message class (`case msg ... else raise`) will now see it — on the first `/clear` of a long-lived session.
- **`origin` on `UserMessage` and `ResultMessage`** (port of Python [#1199](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1199), v0.2.137). In streaming/`Client` mode one connection interleaves the turns the application sends with turns the session injects on its own — background-task notifications, fired scheduled-task prompts, MCP channel messages, messages relayed from peer sessions. `origin` distinguishes them, so a consumer can tell "this result answers my prompt" from a task-notification follow-up. The CLI's object is passed through **verbatim** — including keys this version does not model, so newer origin kinds stay visible — and anything that is not an object with a String `kind` reads as `nil`. **Keys are Symbols and non-`kind` keys keep the CLI's camelCase spelling** (`origin[:fromSession]`), unlike the Python SDK's string-keyed equivalent. Prompts sent through `query()` / `Client#query` arrive unattributed unless the host stamps `origin: { kind: 'human' }` itself.
- **`ClaudeAgentOptions#forward_subagent_text`** (port of Python [#1206](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1206), v0.2.140). Forwards a subagent's text and thinking blocks as messages in the stream, not just its `tool_use` / `tool_result` blocks, so consumers can render the full nested transcript. Negotiated on the control-protocol handshake, so it applies to both `query()` and `Client`. Matches the TypeScript SDK's `forwardSubagentText`.
- **`ClaudeAgentOptions#resume_drops_turn`** (port of Python [#1198](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1198), v0.2.137). Completes the truncating-resume pair alongside the existing `resume_session_at`: names the user prompt whose turn a truncating resume intends to discard, and the CLI refuses the resume if anything past the fork point is not attributable to that turn — so a caller can rewind to "before my last prompt" without silently dropping a queued message or task notification the session absorbed mid-turn and the caller never observed. A refusal surfaces as a `ResultError` whose message contains `Resume rejected by --resume-drops-turn:`; treat it as deterministic rather than retrying. Forwarded in equals form, and an empty string is forwarded rather than dropped so the CLI rejects it as malformed instead of the SDK silently disarming a guard the caller believes is armed. As in the TypeScript and Python SDKs, no SDK-side validation of the option combination is applied.
- **`ClaudeAgentSDK::ResultError`** (port of Python [#1205](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1205), v0.2.140). When a run fails, the CLI emits a `result` with `is_error: true` and then exits non-zero on purpose, for shell-script consumers; the trailing failure carried nothing beyond "exit code 1". The SDK now raises a typed `ResultError` carrying `subtype`, `errors`, `result`, `api_error_status`, `terminal_reason`, `session_id`, the raw `data`, and `original_error` (the bare exit failure it replaced), so callers can branch on *why* a run failed without string matching. It **subclasses `ProcessError`**, so existing `rescue ProcessError` handlers keep working — rescue `ResultError` first to reach the structured fields.
- **`SessionMessage#parent_agent_id`**, and `parent_tool_use_id` is now populated for subagent transcripts (port of Python [#1207](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1207), v0.2.140). `get_subagent_messages` and `get_subagent_messages_from_store` previously returned `parent_tool_use_id: nil` for every message, losing the link to the Agent `tool_use` block in the parent session that spawned the subagent. Both are now recovered from the `agent-<id>.meta.json` sidecar (or the `agent_metadata` entry in a `SessionStore`), and stay `nil` when it is missing or unusable.

### Fixed
- **A refused or failed resume no longer reports a bare "exit code 1" to in-flight control requests** (port of Python [#1198](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1198)). The CLI reports a rejected resume as an error result on stdout and then exits **before** answering the SDK's `initialize`. The read loop already replaced the generic process failure with the CLI's own error text for the message stream, but pending control requests — including that in-flight handshake — were signalled with the raw exception first, so callers saw `Command failed with exit code 1` with the actual reason discarded. Pending requests now receive the same enriched `ResultError`. This also improves resuming a nonexistent session, which takes the same path.
- **`can_use_tool` no longer has its permission requests cut off when it is the only bidirectional feature in use.** The check deciding whether the CLI may still send control requests needing a reply considered only SDK MCP servers and hooks, so an `Enumerator` prompt using `can_use_tool` with neither of those closed stdin as soon as the input ended; any later permission `control_request` then failed CLI-side with "Stream closed". This was a live defect on an already-supported path, independent of the string-prompt change below.
- **Store-backed resume now seeds the caller's `settings.json` and `cowork_settings.json`** into the temporary config directory (port of Python [#1197](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1197), v0.2.137). Only `.credentials.json` and `.claude.json` were copied, leaving behind `apiKeyHelper` — a fourth authentication mechanism alongside the credentials file, the macOS Keychain and environment variables — plus the user's `env`, `hooks` and `permissions`. A host authenticating solely via `apiKeyHelper` therefore failed with **"Not logged in"** the moment it resumed from a store, with nothing in the error pointing at why. Both files pass through a transform dropping `enabledPlugins` / `extraKnownMarketplaces` (which would reconcile against the always-empty temporary plugin cache and network-install every declared marketplace on each resume) and `env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (which would point the subprocess's config reads back out of the temporary directory). A UTF-8 BOM is tolerated, content that is not a JSON object is copied through byte-for-byte, and the result is written `0600`.
- **A seed file that cannot be read no longer aborts an otherwise-valid resume.** These files are best-effort enrichment of the temporary config directory: a failure other than "not found" is now logged and skipped (removing any partial destination) rather than propagating. Readers also check for a regular file before opening, so a directory or a FIFO in place of a config file is skipped instead of raising — or, for a FIFO, hanging the resume forever.
- **An unusable subagent metadata sidecar no longer breaks every later resume.** `JSON.parse` is lenient about illegal bytes inside an otherwise well-formed UTF-8-tagged document, returning a Hash holding invalidly-encoded values that only fail later, at generate time. Session import persisted such a Hash as an `agent_metadata` entry, and every subsequent resume through that store then died re-serializing it with an opaque `JSON::GeneratorError` — permanently, until the store entry was repaired externally. Unusable bytes are now treated as an absent sidecar, matching the helper's documented contract. The same regular-file guard prevents a FIFO sidecar from hanging `get_subagent_messages`.
- **`settings.json` containing a lone surrogate escape is no longer copied through unstripped.** Ruby's `JSON.parse` rejects lone surrogates outright, which fell back to the byte-for-byte passthrough — so `enabledPlugins` survived and the resumed CLI went on network-installing marketplaces on every resume, the exact misbehavior the seeding transform exists to prevent.
- **Redacting `.credentials.json` no longer aborts a resume on a serialization failure**, and its comment now describes what the code actually does; the rescue covered only parse failures, so a generate failure propagated and took down a resume that every other seed-file path is designed to survive.

### Changed
- **`can_use_tool` now works with a String prompt** (port of Python [#1204](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1204), v0.2.140). The callback previously required an `Enumerator` prompt and raised `ArgumentError` otherwise. The SDK is always streaming internally, so the restriction was unnecessary once stdin is held open for the permission round-trip. Validation of the `can_use_tool` / `permission_prompt_tool_name` conflict and the shadowing advisory are now shared by `query()` and `Client#connect` instead of duplicated.


## [0.30.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **`ClaudeAgentSDK::CLIInstaller`** — downloads a pinned `claude` CLI binary into a project-local directory (`vendor/claude` by default) for hermetic deploys, so a Docker image or CI job runs a known CLI version instead of whatever `npm install -g` last put on `PATH`. `CLIInstaller.install(version: '2.1.220', dir: nil)` resolves `stable`/`latest` dist-tags through the official release endpoint, verifies the platform's SHA-256 from the release manifest, streams the ~280MB binary to an unpredictable sibling temp file (opened `O_EXCL`, so a pre-planted path or symlink is never written through) and renames it into place atomically (`0755`), then records the version **and** the verified checksum in a sibling `VERSION` file. `CLIInstaller.installed_path` returns the vendored binary or `nil`. Stdlib only — no new runtime dependency, and no binary shipped inside the gem. Supports macOS and Linux (glibc + musl, x86_64 + arm64, with a Rosetta 2 override so an x86_64 Ruby on Apple Silicon gets the native build); every failure raises the new `ClaudeAgentSDK::CLIInstallError`, filesystem errors included (wrapped, with `cause` preserved).
  - **Idempotent without trusting the recorded version alone**: the shortcut re-hashes the vendored binary and skips the download only when version *and* checksum match, so a truncated or swapped binary is reinstalled rather than used. It makes no network request — repeat boots work offline.
  - **Concurrency-safe**: an exclusive `flock` on `<dir>/.install.lock` covers dist-tag resolution and the whole check → download → record → publish sequence (last resolver wins, so a slow installer cannot downgrade a newer version published while it waited), and the `VERSION` file is written atomically (temp + rename), so parallel installs into one directory can never observe or produce a half-installed state. Temp files abandoned by an install that was killed before it could clean up are swept on the next run. Discovery (`installed_path`, `find_cli`) stays lock-free: the binary only ever changes by an atomic rename of a fully verified file, so a reader sees the intact old binary or the intact new one.
  - **A failed install never breaks a working one**: the binary is downloaded, verified and *recorded* before the rename that publishes it, and nothing can fail after that rename. A failed upgrade therefore leaves the previously installed binary intact and runnable, with the next `install` redoing it cleanly; a failed first install leaves nothing behind.
  - Text responses are size-capped (1KB for the version endpoint, 5MB for the manifest), and the binary download is bounded by the manifest's declared `size` when present — an over-long stream is aborted instead of filling the disk. The binary streams to disk and is never buffered in memory.
- **CLI discovery now honors `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` and the vendored binary.** `SubprocessCLITransport#find_cli` probes `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` (when it points at an executable), then `CLIInstaller.installed_path`, then the existing `which claude` and common-location logic. The vendored copy deliberately outranks `PATH` — that is what makes a pinned install hermetic. `CLINotFoundError` now also mentions both escape hatches.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **Skill names in `ClaudeAgentOptions#skills` are now validated** (port of Python SDK [#1145](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/1145), v0.2.129). Names were formatted into the `--allowedTools` value unchecked; the CLI splits that value into permission rules on commas and spaces outside parentheses with no escape sequences, so a name carrying a delimiter could not be passed through reliably. The command builder now validates each name and fails closed with `ArgumentError` (`TypeError` for non-String entries). Rejected: parentheses, commas, control characters (C0, DEL, C1), U+FEFF, empty names; a literal `*` and wildcard suffixes (`:*`, ` *`); and shapes that parse but can never match the listed skill — surrounding whitespace (Unicode-aware, unlike `String#strip`), a leading `/`, consecutive backslashes, a trailing unpaired backslash, and byte sequences that cannot form valid UTF-8 (Ruby's analogue of Python's surrogate check). Ordinary names are unaffected, including plugin-qualified names, interior spaces, single backslashes, and non-ASCII; valid non-UTF-8 strings are converted so the argv join cannot raise `Encoding::CompatibilityError`.
  - **Breaking:** `skills: ['*']` and `skills: ['plugin:*']` now raise — use `skills: 'all'`, or a `Skill(...)` rule in `allowed_tools` for prefix matching. `skills: [' name']` and `skills: ['/name']` now raise as well; both previously built a rule that could never match, so the skill was silently unavailable.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-31

### Changed
- **`callback_wrapper` now composes around timeout-bounded SessionStore adapter dispatch** (mirror-batcher appends and every resume-materialization store call), inside the timeout bound — on the worker thread in the default thread-hop mode, inside the cooperative timeout for inline-declared adapters. A Rails `executor.wrap` wrapper therefore covers an ActiveRecord-backed store adapter too: connections check out and back in per call instead of stranding on the throwaway thread. The bound itself is unchanged (`JoinTimeout` semantics, no-retry-on-timeout); a wrapper-raised error is treated like a store error (retryable on the batcher path). Previously the timeout path silently ignored the wrapper.

### Fixed
- `SdkMcpServer#callback_scheduling=` / `#callback_wrapper=` now validate like their `ClaudeAgentOptions` counterparts: the String form (`"inline"`) is coerced to the Symbol, and invalid values raise `ArgumentError` at set time. Previously the bare accessors accepted anything, and because the dispatch layer special-cases only the exact Symbol `:inline`, a String or typo silently degraded to the thread hop — the opposite of what an inline host asked for.
- The once-per-process `:inline`-under-`isolation_level = :thread` warning is now emitted under a mutex, closing a benign race where two sessions connecting concurrently could both warn.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **Fiber-native SessionStore adapters** (#47 phase 3): an adapter whose IO is entirely Fiber-scheduler-aware can declare it by defining an optional `callback_scheduling` method returning `:inline`. Every timeout-bounded store call the SDK makes (mirror-batcher appends; resume-materialization loads **and** the listing methods `list_sessions` / `list_session_summaries` / `list_subkeys`) then runs in place on the reactor fiber under a **cooperative** timeout — interrupted at the next suspension point with `ensure` blocks running — instead of on a throwaway thread with a hard `Thread#join` bound. The outward exception contract is unchanged (`FiberBoundary::JoinTimeout`); undeclared adapters are byte-for-byte untouched, and outside a reactor the hard bound still applies even for declared adapters. Cancellation reaches only the adapter's own fiber (offloaded work may still land afterwards), so timed-out appends are not retried in either mode and may remain permanently half-applied in the store — the drop is surfaced (`MirrorErrorMessage`, `batches_dropped?`) and the local transcript remains the source of truth. An invalid declared value fails fast with `ArgumentError` at construction, and a declaration that itself raises propagates its own exception at the same construction point rather than mid-session (conformance contract 17 covers both). Apps can opt a third-party fiber-native adapter in via `def store.callback_scheduling = :inline`.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **`ClaudeAgentOptions#callback_wrapper`** (#47 phase 2): optional middleware wrapped around every user-callback dispatch (message blocks, observers, hooks, permission callbacks, SDK MCP handlers). A callable receiving a zero-arg invocation that it must call and return: `callback_wrapper: ->(inv) { Rails.application.executor.wrap { inv.call } }`. The wrapper runs on the same execution context as the callback — inside the worker thread in the default `:thread` mode (so `executor.wrap` checks ActiveRecord connections back in when the callback ends, retiring the stranded-connection workaround without adopting `:inline`), in place on the reactor fiber in `:inline` mode. Exceptions propagate through it unchanged. Also settable per SDK MCP server for direct calls (`server.callback_wrapper=`); session dispatches carry the session's wrapper via the same fiber-storage scope as `callback_scheduling`. See "Rails executor around callbacks" in docs/rails.md.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **Opt-in fiber-native callback execution: `callback_scheduling: :inline`** (#47). By default the SDK hops every user callback (message blocks, hooks, permission callbacks, SDK MCP handlers, observers) to a plain thread so thread-keyed libraries (ActiveRecord, pg, …) never see the async gem's Fiber scheduler. Hosts that are fiber-isolated end to end — e.g. solid_queue fiber workers (`fibers: N`) with `ActiveSupport::IsolatedExecutionState.isolation_level = :fiber` — can now pass `ClaudeAgentOptions.new(callback_scheduling: :inline)` (or set it globally via `ClaudeAgentSDK.configure`) to run callbacks in place on the reactor fiber: `Fiber.scheduler` is live inside callbacks, no per-call threads exist to strand AR connections, and the session can live directly on the job fiber. This matches the Python SDK's execution model (async callbacks run natively on the event loop). Default behavior is unchanged. In `:inline` mode hook timeouts become cooperative cancellations (the hook is interrupted at its next suspension point and its `ensure` blocks run) instead of hard thread abandonment; `SessionStore` adapter calls intentionally stay on threads so a wedged adapter can never stall the reactor. The SDK warns once when `:inline` is enabled under `isolation_level == :thread`. See "Fiber workers (solid_queue)" in docs/rails.md.
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.offload { }` — public escape hatch for `:inline` hosts: runs a heavy piece of a callback on a plain thread instead of the reactor fiber. Shields the reactor from scheduler-opaque blocking that releases the GVL (native DB drivers, file/socket I/O); turns pure-Ruby CPU work into GVL time-slicing instead of a hard stall. A C extension that holds the GVL for the whole computation still freezes the process — move such work to a subprocess. No-op outside a reactor.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-07-27

Parity batch with the Python SDK v0.2.111–v0.2.128 (everything substantive in that span; the rest is bundled-CLI version bumps, which don't apply to this gem).

### Fixed
- **argv flag injection via `resume` / `session_id` / `resume_session_at`** (Python #1123): these values are now passed as single `=`-joined argv tokens (`--resume=<value>`). The CLI declares `--resume [value]` with an *optional* value, so in the old two-token form a dash-leading untrusted value (e.g. a session id taken from a request) was not bound to the flag and parsed as an independent CLI flag — letting it inject e.g. `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. `extra_args` values starting with `-` are likewise emitted in `--flag=value` form (Python #1127); other `extra_args` values keep the two-token form.
- **Premature stdin close while background tasks are in flight** (Python #1103): a `result` frame ends one *turn*, not the run. The SDK no longer closes stdin on a result while `run_in_background` subagents (task types `local_agent`/`local_workflow`) are still running — previously their SDK-MCP tool calls failed with `"Stream closed"` and their PreToolUse hooks were silently bypassed (deny-gates stopped gating). In-flight tasks are tracked from `task_started` / `task_notification` / terminal `task_updated` lifecycle frames; stdin closes on the first result with none in flight. Background shells/teammates are deliberately not tracked (they may never reach a terminal status, which would withhold the close forever).
- **Leaked CLI child when a cancellation interrupts `close`** (Python #1082): the graceful TERM→KILL escalation in `SubprocessCLITransport#close` suspends (task sleep, thread join), so `Async::Stop` delivered mid-close abandoned it and left a live `claude` child running until interpreter exit. `close` now guarantees termination from an `ensure` with no suspension points: synchronous SIGTERM immediately, then a plain background thread escalates to SIGKILL after a 2s grace period; on that path the child also deliberately stays in the `at_exit` registry as a second safety net, and the stdin/stdout/stderr pipes are closed best-effort (references cleared first, so even a failed close leaves them collectable) instead of leaking descriptors for the life of the transport object.

### Added
- `ResultMessage#terminal_reason` (Python #1142): why the query loop ended (`"completed"`, `"max_turns"`, `"aborted_streaming"`, …). `"aborted_streaming"` / `"aborted_tools"` mean the turn was cancelled via `Client#interrupt`. `nil` when the CLI does not report one (older CLIs, or a result that bypassed the query loop such as a local slash command).
- **Advisory warning when `can_use_tool` is shadowed** (Python #1081): the callback is only consulted when the CLI's permission ladder lands on "ask", so `permission_mode: 'bypassPermissions'` or an `allowed_tools` entry that allows a whole tool (`'Read'`, `'Read()'`, `'Read(*)'` — including the bare `Skill` implied by `skills: 'all'`) silently turns a security callback into dead code. `query()` / `Client#connect` now warn to stderr, once per distinct message per process (`ClaudeAgentSDK::OptionWarnings.reset!` clears the dedupe for tests). Real specifiers (`'Bash(ls:*)'`) and malformed entries don't warn; never raises. The permission-callback docs/example no longer demonstrate the shadowed combination.
- Documented the `ResultMessage#model_usage` per-model value shape (verbatim CLI camelCase keys, matching the TS/Python `ModelUsage` type), including the new optional `canonicalModel` and `provider` keys (Python #1143 — type-only upstream, so a doc change here).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- `ClaudeAgentOptions.advisor_model` enables Claude Code's experimental server-side [advisor tool](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/advisor) (`--advisor` CLI flag): the main model consults a stronger advisor model at key decision points. Accepts a model alias (`'opus'`) or full model ID. Anthropic API only; the CLI validates the main-model/advisor pairing, so invalid pairings surface as `ProcessError`. Consultations appear in `AssistantMessage` content as `ServerToolUseBlock` (name `'advisor'`) and `ServerToolResultBlock` blocks, which the SDK already parsed. See `examples/advisor_example.rb` and the new "Advisor Model" section in `docs/configuration.md`.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-07-03

Final batch (Batch D) from the 2026-07-03 full-codebase audit, closing it out: tests/docs/examples plus the three recorded split-verdict findings (P1-P3). Minor because the conformance suite gained a contract (an adapter that passed 0.21.0 can now fail contract 16) and new API surface (`check_uuid_dedupe:`).

### Fixed
- OTel observer: the next turn's prompt is no longer dropped from the new trace after an interrupted turn or `/clear` (a superseding init with no ResultMessage) — prompts arriving while the current trace already has its input are buffered for the next trace instead of being latched out; a prompt queued mid-turn now labels its own trace too.
- Disk session listings no longer misclassify a session as a sidechain from a nested `"isSidechain":true` inside a structured field: the first line is parsed and the top-level key checked (same as the store fold), with the substring heuristic kept only for window-truncated first lines.
- SDK MCP servers: propertyless object schemas (`{ type: 'object', additionalProperties: ... }`, `oneOf`, accept-anything forms) now pass through intact instead of being mangled into nonsense parameter lists ("additionalProperties" advertised as a required string param).
- `import_session_to_store` skips an unparseable trailing line with a warning (an ordinary interrupted-CLI artifact every read path already tolerates) instead of aborting mid-import with a raw `JSON::ParserError` and leaving a partial store import behind.
- Redis reference adapter: the delete cascade now WATCHes the subkey set, so a concurrent eager-mode append can no longer orphan a freshly-created subagent list forever; both the Redis and Postgres reference adapters stamp mtimes through a monotonic guard (like S3) so a backward clock step can't misdirect `--continue`.
- Redis example spec no longer FLUSHDBs whatever `SESSION_STORE_REDIS_URL` points at — it uses a random key prefix per run with prefix-scoped cleanup, like the Postgres spec.

### Added
- Conformance suite contract 16: `list_sessions` must return exactly one row per session under multiple appends (the naive one-row-per-append implementation previously passed every contract, then showed N duplicate sessions in pickers). Contract 4 now also asserts `append([])` cannot create a phantom key. New opt-in `check_uuid_dedupe:` flag asserts the advisory retried-batch uuid-dedupe recommendation.
- `--continue` with a store that implements `list_session_summaries` skips sidechain candidates via the summary sidecar instead of downloading every candidate's full transcript.

### Changed
- `RUN_INTEGRATION=1` now actually runs the real-CLI integration suite (the old tautological placeholder suite is gone; `RUN_REAL_INTEGRATION` remains as an alias). The real suite still self-skips without a `claude` CLI or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- Packaged docs/README now link to examples and repo files via absolute GitHub URLs — the relative links were dead in installed gems and on rubydoc.info (examples/ and assets/ are not packaged).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-03

Design-decision fix batch (Batch C) from the 2026-07-03 full-codebase audit (`AUDIT-2026-07-03.md`, PR #43), plus three teardown-race hardenings from its adversarial review. Minor (not patch) because three fixes change observable behavior for previously-broken flows: a missing settings file with sandbox no longer raises, a raising initial prompt stream no longer notifies observers, and teardown can now preserve (instead of delete) the materialized resume dir.

### Fixed
- `Query#close` (and therefore `Client#disconnect`) is now safe to call from any thread. Calling it from a FiberBoundary worker — e.g. a tool handler, hook, or permission callback ending the session — crashed with `NoMethodError` (nil `Fiber.scheduler`) and left the read/child tasks running, hanging the enclosing reactor. A transient reactor-side watcher now serves closes marshaled from foreign threads with identical semantics; once the reactor is gone, close falls back to a direct (fiber-dead-safe) teardown. `close` is also idempotent now — concurrent or repeated closes no longer re-run teardown against half-torn-down state.
- Eager-mode mirror failures during the last flush of a stream are reported before the `'end'` sentinel: the `MirrorErrorMessage` for an in-flight dropped batch could previously be enqueued after `'end'` and never delivered, violating the documented "failures surface as MirrorErrorMessage" guarantee.
- Disk session listings no longer report tool-argument text as the session summary/title: the head/tail byte-scans for `summary`/`customTitle`/`aiTitle`/`lastPrompt` now verify each match against the top level of its containing JSONL line (the same keys the SessionStore fold reads), so keys nested inside tool_use inputs (subagent/teammate tool arguments) are ignored. Lines truncated at the 64KB window edge keep the raw-scan value.
- Resume-from-store teardown no longer deletes the only copy of turns the mirror failed to persist: when the batcher dropped batches (tracked via `TranscriptMirrorBatcher#batches_dropped?` / `Query#mirror_batches_dropped?`, including drains cancelled mid-flight), the materialized temp `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is preserved — credential copies scrubbed, transcripts kept, warning with the path — instead of removed.
- A missing settings file with `sandbox` set now warns and continues with sandbox-only settings (Python parity) instead of raising `CLIConnectionError`.
- `Client#connect` no longer fires observer `on_error` for a raising initial Enumerator prompt: input-stream errors are swallowed-with-warn (documented `Observer#on_error` contract, `query()` and Python parity). Notifying them also marked still-live OTel traces as failed.
- Postgres reference adapter (`examples/session_stores/postgres_session_store.rb`): all DB round-trips now serialize through an internal mutex — mirror appends run on fresh worker threads and can overlap after a send-timeout abandon, which pg's single-connection thread rules forbid. The "a single PG::Connection suffices" concurrency guidance was wrong and has been rewritten.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-03

Behavioral fix batch (Batch B) from the 2026-07-03 full-codebase audit (`AUDIT-2026-07-03.md`, PR #42). Every fix aligns code with a documented contract or Python SDK behavior and changes behavior only for inputs that previously produced wrong results, hangs, or crashes. Minor (not patch) because two fixes raise where the SDK previously reported success: a signal-killed CLI now raises `ProcessError`, and assistant messages without `message.model` now raise `MessageParseError`.

### Fixed
- A CLI process killed by a signal (OOM-kill SIGKILL, SIGSEGV, ...) now raises `ProcessError` ("Command terminated by signal N", `exit_code: -N` — Python returncode parity) instead of reporting a **truncated** response as clean end-of-stream success.
- A trailing title-clearing entry (`{"customTitle":""}`, or whitespace-only) no longer silently drops the whole session from `list_sessions`/`get_session_info` disk listings: blank values now fall through the summary/title fallback chains exactly like the SessionStore path and Python (`or` semantics).
- `continue_conversation: true` with a SessionStore adapter that reports mtimes as Strings (the natural SQL-timestamp-through-JSON shape) no longer silently resumes the **oldest** session: String mtimes (ISO-8601 or numeric) are coerced and ordered chronologically, and mixed Integer/String lists no longer raise a bare `ArgumentError`. The conformance suite already pins the epoch-ms Numeric contract.
- One malformed line in a transcript head (non-Hash entry, string `message`, non-string `text`) no longer drops the whole session from disk listings — the guards ported from Python skip just the bad line. An assistant line whose tool_use input embeds `"type":"user"` can no longer donate its text as the session's first prompt.
- A user message block that leaks `StopIteration` (e.g. `.next` on an exhausted Enumerator) no longer silently ends message reception mid-turn — previously the `ResultMessage` was dropped and `receive_response`/`query()` returned as if the turn had completed; the error now propagates.
- Top-level `query()` now validates the prompt like `Client#query` and fails fast at the call site: a bare Hash (which would stream `[key, value]` garbage to the CLI) and non-String/non-`#each` prompts (which hung forever) raise `ArgumentError`.
- One-shot `query()` now sends `exclude_dynamic_sections` from a preset system prompt in the initialize request (it was silently dropped; `Client` and Python both send it).
- `ClaudeAgentOptions#dup_with` now deep-duplicates nested containers: mutating a derived variant (`variant.allowed_tools << 'Bash'`) no longer bleeds into the base options and every sibling variant — including the security-relevant allow/deny lists. Leaf objects (callbacks, SDK MCP server instances, store adapters) keep identity, mirroring `Configuration#default_options`. Container deep-dup (both here and in `Configuration#default_options` merging) now also preserves Hash/Array subclasses — a Rails `HashWithIndifferentAccess` config no longer flattens into a plain Hash whose symbol lookups silently return nil.
- Sandbox gating in command building now matches Python's `sandbox is not None`: `sandbox: true` (the boolean toggle) no longer crashes with `NoMethodError: undefined method 'empty?' for true`, and an explicit `sandbox: false` / `{}` is forwarded to the CLI instead of silently dropped — so `sandbox: false` can actually override a sandbox enabled in the settings JSON.
- `output_format: { type: 'json_schema' }` with a nil/absent schema no longer emits `--json-schema null` (which the CLI rejects at spawn); the flag is skipped, matching Python's `schema is not None` guard.
- A non-Hash `message` field in a user/assistant CLI message now raises the documented `MessageParseError` instead of a raw `TypeError`.
- Assistant messages missing `message.model` now raise `MessageParseError` (Python parity) instead of silently constructing `AssistantMessage(model: nil)`.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-07-03

Zero-risk fix batch from the 2026-07-03 full-codebase audit (`AUDIT-2026-07-03.md`, PR #41).

### Added
- `lib/claude-agent-sdk.rb` require shim: `Bundler.require` now loads the SDK in default Rails/Bundler apps. Previously Bundler tried `claude-agent-sdk` and `claude/agent/sdk`, silently swallowed both LoadErrors, and left `ClaudeAgentSDK` undefined until a confusing `NameError` at first use.

### Fixed
- `require 'claude_agent_sdk/instrumentation'` now loads the SDK core, so the documented Rails observability initializer (and `OTelObserver`'s own `@example`) works as the only require.
- Typed `McpStdioServerConfig` / `McpSSEServerConfig` / `McpHttpServerConfig` / `McpSdkServerConfig` objects passed directly in `mcp_servers` (without `.to_h`) now serialize to their wire hash instead of a `#<...>` string the CLI cannot parse — and `McpSdkServerConfig` instances now actually register their in-process server, so its tools connect.
- `create_tool` with a Symbol name produced a tool that was advertised in `tools/list` but failed every invocation with 'Tool not found'; names are now coerced to String.
- One stdout line carrying invalid UTF-8 bytes no longer aborts the whole message stream (which dropped all buffered valid frames, including a trailing `result`); the bad line is scrubbed, matching the version-probe path.
- `fork_session` no longer hangs forever on a transcript with a `parentUuid` cycle among progress entries.
- `fork_session` / `delete_session` no longer stop at a 0-byte transcript stub: they fall through to the worktree project dir holding the real transcript, mirroring the read path. A session whose *only* copy is a 0-byte stub now raises `Errno::ENOENT`, consistent with the read paths that already hide it.
- Long-lived `Client`s using SDK MCP servers no longer leak one finished internal task per synchronously-handled control request (MCP metadata requests, unsupported subtypes).
- An observer implementing none of the observer interface — most commonly a Class passed instead of an instance (`observers: [OTelObserver]`) — is now warned about and skipped instead of producing silent zero instrumentation.

### Changed
- The gem packages git-tracked files only (previously a working-tree glob, which shipped stray untracked files under `lib/`/`docs/` in locally built gems). `gem build` from a tree with tracked-but-deleted files now fails fast instead of silently packaging whatever was on disk.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- `TaskUpdatedMessage` — typed `system`/`task_updated` lifecycle events (Python SDK 0.2.101 / #1016 parity). A background task's terminal state can arrive *only* as a `task_updated` patch with no accompanying `TaskNotificationMessage` (e.g. a `TaskStop`-killed task reports `status: 'killed'` here), so consumers tracking active task IDs no longer hang waiting for a notification that never comes. `status` is derived from `patch['status']` (parsed defensively — a non-Hash/absent patch falls back to `{}`, `task_id` defaults to `''` so it is never nil, and parsing never raises). New `TASK_UPDATED_STATUSES` and `TERMINAL_TASK_STATUSES` constants; the latter spans both lifecycle vocabularies (`task_notification` reports `stopped`, `task_updated` reports the raw `killed`) so a terminal status from *either* message clears active-task tracking.

### Fixed
- Malformed CLI message content now raises a descriptive `MessageParseError` instead of an opaque `TypeError`/`NoMethodError` (Python SDK #1058 parity): a non-Hash content block (e.g. a bare String) and an assistant `content` that is not an Array are both caught with a clear message carrying the full payload, rather than crashing deep inside block parsing on `block[:type]`.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `query(transport:)` — inject a pre-constructed custom transport instance (Python parity): CLI discovery, version check, and resume materialization are skipped; the SDK calls `#connect`/`#close` on the instance (including after a failed connect — a documented safety deviation from Python).
- `Client#query` now accepts an Enumerable of message Hashes / JSONL Strings in addition to a String (Python parity): items stream inline on the caller, `session_id` is stamped onto Hashes that lack one (explicit values, even nil, preserved), and non-Hash/String items raise instead of being silently serialized. Note: JSONL String items pass through verbatim and carry their own `session_id` — generate them with the matching `session_id:` argument (`Streaming.user_message` defaults to `'default'`).
- `Client.open(prompt = nil, options:, ...) { |client| }` — block-scoped lifecycle mirroring Python's `async with ClaudeSDKClient()`: connects, yields, always disconnects; works standalone (creates a reactor via `Sync`) and inside `Async` blocks; returns the block's value.
- `ClaudeAgentOptions#user` is now applied — the CLI subprocess is spawned as that OS user via spawn's `:uid` (String username or Integer uid, Unix; previously accepted but silently ignored). On unsupported platforms the failure is loud (`CLIConnectionError`), not silent.
- `HookMatcher#timeout` is now sent to the CLI in the initialize request (per matcher, seconds — Python wire parity); the SDK-side enforcement remains as defense-in-depth.
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.list_subagents` / `ClaudeAgentSDK.get_subagent_messages` — local-disk subagent transcript readers (disk counterparts to the existing `*_from_store` variants; Python SDK parity, upstream #825). Scans `<projectDir>/<sessionId>/subagents/**/agent-<id>.jsonl` including nested `workflows/<runId>/` paths. Note: `limit: 0` returns `[]` per the Ruby read-API family convention (Python returns all).
- W3C trace-context propagation to the CLI subprocess (Python SDK #821 parity): when `opentelemetry` is loaded and a span is active at connect, `TRACEPARENT`/`TRACESTATE` (and any other propagator carrier keys such as `BAGGAGE`, uppercased) are injected into the CLI env so CLI-side OTel spans join the caller's distributed trace. Explicit `ClaudeAgentOptions#env` keys win; stale inherited W3C env is scrubbed only when an active span replaces it. No new dependency — no-op without the opentelemetry gem.
- `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` env var skips the CLI version check (any non-empty value, Python parity), and the check itself now has a 2-second deadline — a hung `claude -v` (NFS-mounted binary, wedged Node bootstrap) no longer hangs `connect` forever. The unsupported-version warning now includes the CLI path.
- `ClaudeAgentOptions#skills` (Python parity): enable skills for the main session with `'all'` or an Array of names. Injects `Skill`/`Skill(name)` into `--allowedTools`, defaults `setting_sources` to `['user', 'project']` when unset, and sends explicit lists via the `initialize` control request so the CLI filters which skills load. `[]` hides all skills; this is a context filter, not a sandbox.
- OTel spans now report prompt-cache usage: `gen_ai.usage.cache_creation_input_tokens` / `gen_ai.usage.cache_read_input_tokens` on generation and session spans, plus OpenInference `llm.token_count.prompt_details.cache_read`/`.cache_write` on the session span. Anthropic's `input_tokens` excludes cached tokens, so heavily cached sessions previously under-reported prompt volume by orders of magnitude. Strictly additive — existing keys unchanged.
- `on_user_prompt` observers now fire for Enumerator/streaming-input prompts (once per `type: 'user'` message with extractable text). OTel traces for streaming sessions now get an `input.value` for the first trace; later turns' capture depends on prompt timing relative to each init (`OTelObserver` keeps one prompt per trace).

### Fixed
- `SubprocessCLITransport#end_input` now takes the stdin mutex like write/close (its lock-free close could race a concurrent writer into a misleading "undefined method ... for nil" error that also poisoned `@exit_error`).
- `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` now defaults to `sdk-rb` regardless of inherited process env (an ambient `cli` value from running inside a Claude Code terminal previously won via `||=`, mis-attributing telemetry); `options.env` can still override it. `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_VERSION` is now always SDK-set, never overridable (Python merge-order parity).
- Unknown hook events now arrive as `UnknownHookInput` carrying the wire `hook_event_name` and the complete raw payload (previously all event-specific fields were dropped and the name was nil; Python passes the raw dict through, losing nothing).
- Oversized CLI stdout lines no longer allocate unbounded memory: the read loop's 1MB buffer cap previously fired only AFTER `each_line` had read the whole line into memory; reads are now chunk-bounded at `max_buffer_size + 1` bytes (Python's TextReceiveStream reads ≤64KB chunks — same incremental-cap semantics). The same bound applies to the stderr drain loops.
- `advisor_tool_result` content blocks now parse into `ServerToolResultBlock` (they previously fell through to `UnknownBlock`); the `server_tool_result` wire type was dead code — no CLI version emits it — and now takes the forward-compat `UnknownBlock` path.
- README's Client quick-start example used `receive_messages` with no termination and hung forever when pasted; it now uses `receive_response`.
- `Configuration#default_options` containers are now deep-duplicated when constructing `ClaudeAgentOptions`: `options.allowed_tools << 'Bash'` in one session no longer mutates the global default (cross-session permission widening) and nested default hashes/arrays no longer leak mutations. Leaf objects (callbacks, observer factories, SDK MCP server instances) keep identity.
- Hash-form `thinking` config (`{ type: 'adaptive'|'enabled'|'disabled', budget_tokens:, display: }`) is now serialized to the CLI; it was previously dropped silently and also suppressed the `max_thinking_tokens` fallback. Invalid shapes raise a clear `ArgumentError`.
- Control-protocol client methods (`interrupt`, `set_model`, …) can now be called from inside hook/`can_use_tool`/SDK-MCP callbacks (Python reentrancy parity): the call previously wrote the request to the CLI and then crashed with an opaque `RuntimeError: No async task available!`, silently dropping the response. Worker-thread callers now wait on a level-triggered queue with the same timeout semantics.
- Closed a lost-wakeup race in control-request waiting: `Async::Condition` is edge-triggered, so a `control_response` arriving while the sender was still suspended in a transport write was dropped and the caller waited the full 1200s timeout (reachable with custom transports whose `#write` suspends after delivery, and via the read-loop error broadcast). Senders now check the result slot before and between waits (anyio.Event level-trigger semantics, like Python).
- `SdkMcpServer#handle_json` now actually serves resources and prompts: `resources/list` crashed inside the mcp gem (`Class#to_h`), `resources/read` silently returned `{contents: []}` for every URI (the read path referenced `MCP::ResourceContents`, a constant that has never existed in any mcp gem version), `prompts/list` mangled names (`codeReview` → `code_review`) and dropped descriptions/arguments, and `prompts/get` could not find any prompt. Resources are now served as `MCP::Resource` instances with the gem's registered read handler; prompts via `MCP::Prompt.define`. Both delegate to the SDK's own readers, preserving the FiberBoundary hop and result validation.
- Pre-built JSON Schemas with symbol values (`type: :object`) are no longer silently mangled into garbage (schema meta-keys leaked as parameters, every valid `tools/call` was then rejected with "Missing required arguments: type, properties, required"). Schema normalization is now a single source of truth; `additionalProperties`/`enum`/`description` survive, and a malformed pre-built schema raises a clear error lazily instead of producing silent garbage.
- `list_sessions`, `get_session_info`, and `get_session_messages` no longer raise `Errno::ENOENT` for a `directory:` that does not exist — they return `[]`/`nil`, matching the Python SDK (a fresh checkout or a deleted project directory previously crashed; sessions recorded for a since-deleted directory are now found again).
- `get_session_messages` and `import_session_to_store` no longer stop at a 0-byte transcript stub: the session-file search skips empty files and continues to worktree project dirs, matching Python's `st_size > 0` resolver (a stub in the canonical project dir previously hid the real worktree transcript).
- An empty `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is now treated as unset (falling back to `~/.claude`, NFC-normalized) across all session read/mutation paths and SessionStore mirroring, matching the Node CLI and Python SDK — previously the projects dir resolved to `/projects` and transcript mirroring was silently disabled.
- `list_sessions` / `get_session_info` no longer return `created_at: nil` when a transcript's first JSONL record is a metadata-only entry (e.g. `permission-mode`) with no `timestamp` field — the whole 64 KiB head window is now scanned for the first timestamp (Python #907 parity). The store-backed readers already folded every entry, so the disk and store paths now agree on `created_at`.
- `Observer#on_error` is now actually invoked — once per error surfacing from `query()` or `Client#query`/`#receive_messages`/`#receive_response`/`#connect`, before `on_close` where both fire. Crashed sessions now produce OTel traces with error status and a recorded exception.
- `OTelObserver` no longer mislabels traces when one instance is reused: the buffered prompt/output are reset at every trace boundary (previously every trace after the first showed the first query's prompt as its `input.value`, and a nil-result trace could leak the previous query's output).
- `OTelObserver` no longer leaks unfinished (never-exported) spans: a new `InitMessage` without an intervening `ResultMessage` finishes the superseded root span, and tool spans still pending at a `ResultMessage` or superseded init are finished at that boundary instead of waiting for `on_close`.
- OTel tool spans now serialize Array tool-result content as JSON with `output.mime_type: application/json` (previously Ruby `inspect` format); String results gain `output.mime_type: text/plain`; nil results omit `output.value` (previously empty string).
- `break` inside the user block of `query()`, `Client#receive_messages` and `Client#receive_response` now stops iteration (returning the break value) instead of raising `LocalJumpError` — the FiberBoundary thread hop translates the break back to the calling fiber (new internal `FiberBoundary.invoke_iteration`).
- CLI stdout/stderr are now always decoded as UTF-8: under `LANG=C`/`LC_ALL=C` (minimal Docker images, systemd, CI) the pipes inherited US-ASCII and the first non-ASCII byte from the CLI killed the read loop with `Encoding::CompatibilityError`. Mirrors the Python SDK's UTF-8 `TextReceiveStream`.
- The unsupported-CLI-version warning now actually fires: `Array#<` does not exist, so the version comparison raised `NoMethodError` into the version check's blanket rescue and the warning had never been emitted; the `-v` output is also UTF-8-scrubbed so a stray invalid byte cannot suppress it.
- `query()` can no longer hang forever when the CLI dies while a streaming-input Enumerator is blocked: the input stream task is tracked on the `Query` (new `Query#spawn_task`, mirroring the Python SDK's `_child_tasks`) and stopped by `close`, so the real error now propagates to the caller instead of decaying to an async console warning.
- A CLI crash now always unblocks in-flight control requests (`interrupt`, `set_model`, …) immediately instead of leaving them to the 1200s control-request timeout, and a real crash in a multi-turn session is reported to consumers instead of being silently swallowed after the first result.
- Hooks and SDK MCP servers no longer silently stop working when a one-shot `query()`'s first turn runs past 60 seconds: stdin stays open (without timeout) until the first result, mirroring Python SDK commit c3d96cb. String-prompt queries also now stream messages to the block while that wait is pending instead of deferring delivery.

### Changed
- `Client#connect(enumerable)` now streams the initial prompt in the **background** (Python parity): connect returns immediately instead of blocking until the stream is exhausted (interactive streams that wait for a response before yielding no longer deadlock), Hash messages are serialized as JSON (previously Ruby `inspect` via `to_s` — never valid wire format), stdin closes when the stream is exhausted, and stream errors fire `Observer#on_error` and are logged instead of raising out of `connect`.
- SDK MCP `tools/call` now routes through the official `MCP::Server`: arguments are JSON-Schema-validated (draft4) against the tool's `inputSchema` **before** the handler runs (Python parity — its mcp lowlevel server does the same), and validation failures return in-band `isError` results ("Missing required arguments: …"/"Invalid arguments: …") without invoking the handler. The `mcp` dependency floor rises to `>= 0.6, < 1` (0.4 turned these into protocol errors; 0.5 serializes empty icons arrays into list responses). The SDK normalizes tools/call error envelopes itself, so the gem's per-version error-behavior swings (0.7.1+/0.18 raise protocol errors again) never leak through. Error texts on this path now come from the gem (e.g. "Tool not found: X", "Internal error calling tool X: msg"). Validation can be disabled globally via `MCP.configure { |c| c.validate_tool_call_arguments = false }`. Schemas the draft4 metaschema rejects (numeric `exclusiveMinimum`, `$ref` — valid modern JSON Schema that Python accepts) fall back to validation-disabled with a one-time warning instead of bricking the tool.
- SDK MCP tool failures are now reported **in-band** (`isError: true` with the error text in `content`) instead of as JSON-RPC `-32603` protocol errors — matching the MCP spec, the Python SDK, and the official mcp gem. The model can now read the error text and self-correct. This covers handler exceptions, unknown tools, and malformed handler results; `SdkMcpServer#call_tool` no longer raises for these cases.
- `SdkMcpServer#call_tool`/`#read_resource`/`#get_prompt` now accept string-keyed handler results (Python handlers return string-keyed dicts naturally); previously they rejected them with an error the model saw as a protocol failure.
- When an explicit `directory:` is given, `get_session_messages` and `import_session_to_store` no longer fall back to scanning all project directories: a session that only exists in an unrelated project now returns `[]` / raises `Errno::ENOENT` instead of silently returning/importing another project's data under the wrong project key (Python parity; `directory: nil` still searches all projects). A 0-byte-stub-only session now raises `Errno::ENOENT` from import instead of silently importing zero entries.
- `can_use_tool` callbacks now receive fully populated `ToolPermissionContext`s: the CLI display fields (`title`, `display_name`, `description`, `blocked_path`, `decision_reason`) are forwarded (previously always nil), and `suggestions` are typed `PermissionUpdate` objects instead of raw wire hashes (Python #920 parity) — `PermissionUpdate.new` also hydrates wire-format rule hashes into `PermissionRuleValue`. Code treating suggestion entries as plain Hashes (`dig`, `fetch`) must use the typed accessors; echoing `context.suggestions` into `updated_permissions` keeps working.
- A `ProcessError` that directly follows a result with `is_error: true` (the CLI exits non-zero on purpose, e.g. structured-output errors) is now raised with the structured error text the CLI reported (`Claude Code returned an error result: …`, preserving `exit_code`/`stderr`) instead of ending the stream silently — matching the Python SDK.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_STREAM_CLOSE_TIMEOUT` is now a no-op (the internal `Query::STREAM_CLOSE_TIMEOUT_*` constants were removed with the stdin-close timeout).

### Removed
- **Breaking**: `ClaudeAgentOptions#append_allowed_tools`. It emitted `--append-allowed-tools`, which no Claude Code CLI version accepts (`error: unknown option`), so any use failed at connect. The option never existed in the Python SDK (mis-port in v0.4.0). Use `allowed_tools` instead — the CLI's `--allowedTools` already appends to settings-derived permission rules. Passing `append_allowed_tools:` now raises `ArgumentError` at construction.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Pluggable `SessionStore` adapter subsystem** — mirror Claude Code session transcripts to external storage (S3/Redis/Postgres/…) and resume from it, at parity with the Python SDK (#837 and follow-ups) and TypeScript SDK. The subprocess still writes to local disk; the adapter receives a secondary copy.
  - **`SessionStore`** base class (6-method contract: `append`/`load` required; `list_sessions`/`list_session_summaries`/`delete`/`list_subkeys` optional, probed via `SessionStore.implements?` so duck-typed adapters need not subclass) and **`InMemorySessionStore`** reference implementation. All keys/entries cross the boundary as Hashes with **string keys** (JSON-round-trip safe for JSONB/Redis backends).
  - **`ClaudeAgentSDK::Testing.run_session_store_conformance(make_store)`** — a 15-contract behavioral test suite for adapter authors (shipped in the gem, framework-agnostic; raises `ConformanceError` on violation).
  - **Live mirroring** (on both `ClaudeAgentSDK.query` and `ClaudeAgentSDK::Client`): setting `ClaudeAgentOptions#session_store` emits `--session-mirror`; a `TranscriptMirrorBatcher` coalesces the CLI's `transcript_mirror` frames per file and flushes to `SessionStore#append` on each `result` (or 500-entry / 1 MiB overflow). `session_store_flush: "eager"` flushes after every frame. Append ordering is preserved across concurrent flushes (fiber-aware `Async::Semaphore`); the user store call runs on a `FiberBoundary` thread bounded by a fixed 60 s send timeout (`TranscriptMirrorBatcher::SEND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; `load_timeout_ms` bounds resume-materialization store calls instead); failures retry (3 attempts, 0.2/0.8 s backoff) then surface as a **`MirrorErrorMessage`** on the message stream. A failing store never disrupts the session (the local transcript is already durable).
  - **Resume from store** (both entry points): pairing `session_store` with `resume`/`continue_conversation` materializes the session (and its subagent transcripts) from the store into a temp `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` before spawn, repoints the subprocess at it, and cleans it up after the subprocess exits (on disconnect, one-shot teardown, **and** reactor cancellation). Store-supplied subagent subpaths are validated against path traversal; copied `.credentials.json` has its single-use `refreshToken` redacted; macOS Keychain credentials are bridged when needed.
  - **Store-backed reads** (counterparts to the local readers): `ClaudeAgentSDK.list_sessions_from_store` (summary fast-path + gap-fill + pagination; a single failing row degrades to an empty summary rather than aborting the listing), `.get_session_info_from_store`, `.get_session_messages_from_store`, `.list_subagents_from_store`, `.get_subagent_messages_from_store`.
  - **Store-backed mutations** (counterparts to the local mutators): `ClaudeAgentSDK.rename_session_via_store`, `.tag_session_via_store`, `.delete_session_via_store` (a no-op on WORM/append-only stores that don't implement `#delete`), and `.fork_session_via_store` (the UUID-remap fork transform run directly over the loaded entries — no JSONL round-trip; the fallback title is derived from the source's `customTitle`/`aiTitle`/first prompt).
  - **Reference adapters** under `examples/session_stores/` (S3, Redis, Postgres) — copy-in implementations, each validated against `run_session_store_conformance`. Backend client gems live in the optional `:examples` Bundler group so a default install stays dependency-free.
  - **`ClaudeAgentSDK.import_session_to_store`** — replay a local on-disk session (and subagents) into a store for migration / mirror-gap backfill.
  - **`ClaudeAgentSDK.project_key_for_directory`** and **`.fold_session_summary`** helpers; `ClaudeAgentOptions` gains `session_store`, `session_store_flush` (`"batched"`/`"eager"`), and `load_timeout_ms`. `SessionStore` + `enable_file_checkpointing`, or `continue_conversation` without `list_sessions`, are rejected at connect with a clear error.

### Changed
- `Client#connect` now fully tears the client down (subprocess reaped, temp resume dir removed) when any part of connect fails — previously a failure while sending the initial prompt could leave a half-connected client behind. Matches the Python/TypeScript SDKs.
- A negative `limit:` now returns `[]` consistently across every session reader (`list_sessions`, `get_session_messages`, and all store-backed counterparts) instead of raising `ArgumentError` from an internal `Array#first` on some paths.

### Fixed
- `fork_session` / `fork_session_via_store` now fall back to the documented `"Forked session (fork)"` title for sessions with no title and no extractable first prompt (previously wrote a literal `" (fork)"`).

## [0.16.10] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- `ClaudeAgentOptions#strict_mcp_config` — forwarded as `--strict-mcp-config`. When `true`, the CLI uses **only** the MCP servers passed via `mcp_servers`, ignoring project `.mcp.json`, user/global settings, and plugin-provided servers, for a fully deterministic server set. Defaults to `false`. (Parity with [Python SDK #915](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/915))
- `ClaudeAgentOptions#include_hook_events` — forwarded as `--include-hook-events`. When `true`, the CLI emits hook lifecycle events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, etc.) into the message stream. The parser already maps these to `HookStartedMessage` / `HookProgressMessage` / `HookResponseMessage` (the CLI simply never emitted them without this flag). Defaults to `false`. (Parity with [Python SDK #917](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/917))
- `SandboxNetworkConfig#denied_domains` (`deniedDomains`) and `#allow_mach_lookup` (`allowMachLookup`) — completes the sandbox network allowlist field set. `denied_domains` blocks domains even when matched by `allowed_domains`; `allow_mach_lookup` is a macOS-only list of XPC/Mach service names to allow (supports a trailing wildcard). Completes [Python SDK #893](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/893) — `denied_domains` and `allow_mach_lookup` were the last two fields the Ruby port had not yet landed.
- **Orphaned-subprocess cleanup**: `SubprocessCLITransport` now tracks live CLI subprocesses in a class-level, mutex-guarded `Set` and registers an `at_exit` handler that sends `SIGTERM` to any still running when the parent Ruby process exits. This prevents leaked `claude` processes when callers crash or exit before reaching `#close`. The handler skips already-exited processes (`Process::Waiter#alive?`) and swallows errors so it never interrupts interpreter shutdown. (Parity with [Python SDK #916](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/916))

## [0.16.9] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- `Types.normalize_name` no longer mutates the frozen string returned by `Symbol#to_s` under Ruby 3.4+. The previous `name.dup.to_s` order dup'd the Symbol (a no-op) and then took `.to_s`, which Ruby 3.4 stages to return a frozen string in 4.0 — emitting a deprecation warning on every `gsub!`/`tr!`/`downcase!`. Swapped to `name.to_s.dup`. (#35, @chagel)

## [0.16.8] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- `ServerToolUseBlock` + `ServerToolResultBlock` content blocks for the CLI's built-in server-side tools (web_search, advisor, code_execution). The message parser now recognises `server_tool_use` / `server_tool_result` content types.
- `DeferredToolUse` class and `ResultMessage#deferred_tool_use` field — populated when a PreToolUse hook returns `permissionDecision: "defer"` so the session can be resumed later to execute the deferred call.
- `ResultMessage#api_error_status` — integer HTTP status (429, 500, 529) on the `api_error` subtype, from CLI 2.1.110+.
- `ToolPermissionContext` gains five pre-formatted display fields (`title`, `display_name`, `description`, `blocked_path`, `decision_reason`) populated by CLI 2.1.110+ so `can_use_tool` callbacks can render the same prompt UI the CLI would.
- `PostToolUseHookSpecificOutput#updated_tool_output` — unified tool-output replacement that works for any tool, MCP or built-in (the legacy `updated_mcp_tool_output` field remains for backwards compatibility).

### Changed
- README restructured: the 1857-line single-file reference was slimmed to ~285 lines covering intro, comparison table, install, Quick Start, and minimal `query()`/`Client`/MCP/Hooks examples. Detailed sections moved into a new `docs/` directory with nine topic subpages (`client.md`, `mcp-servers.md`, `hooks-and-permissions.md`, `configuration.md`, `sessions.md`, `observability.md`, `rails.md`, `types.md`, `errors.md`). The README now links to each subpage from a single "Advanced Topics" table.
- `claude-agent-sdk.gemspec` now ships `docs/**/*` so `gem install` includes the topic subpages — the Agentic Coding Skill (and humans browsing `<gem_path>` after `bundle show claude-agent-sdk`) can read the full documentation set without a repo clone.
- `Query#start` now raises `CLIConnectionError` if invoked outside an `Async{}` block. The previous implementation appeared to support synchronous callers but silently hung forever because the outer `Async{}` root task it spawned waited for `read_messages` to finish, which never happens for a live Client. All documented usage (`query()` and the `Client#connect` pattern) already wraps in `Async{}` so this only surfaces a previously hidden failure mode.
- `CommandBuilder` raises `ArgumentError` synchronously when both `continue_conversation` and `resume` are set, instead of producing an opaque non-zero CLI exit at runtime.
- `sdk_mcp_server`'s `read_resource`, `get_prompt`, and the dynamic `Resource#read` / `Prompt#get` callbacks now hop through `FiberBoundary.invoke` (`call_tool` already did). User reader/generator blocks that touch `Thread.current`-keyed libraries (ActiveRecord, pg) no longer see the async-gem fiber scheduler.

### Fixed
- **Transport `@stdin` race**: `write`/`close` are now serialised by a mutex. User callbacks running on `FiberBoundary` threads can no longer race `close()` and hit `NoMethodError` on a nilled `@stdin`. The mutex only guards the reference snapshot — the blocking IO call happens outside the lock so `close` is never blocked by a full pipe buffer.
- **Transport stdout poisoning**: stdout lines that do not start with `{` are skipped when `json_buffer` is empty. Previously the CLI's occasional debug prefixes (e.g. `[SandboxDebug]`) accumulated in the buffer until the 1 MB cap raised `CLIJSONDecodeError` and killed the session. Matches the Python SDK's guard.
- **Transport stderr resilience**: each `stderr` callback invocation is wrapped in `rescue StandardError`, so a transiently failing user logger no longer terminates the read loop and silently stops stderr capture for the lifetime of the process. Matches Python SDK v0.2.82 (PR #932).
- **Transport process reaping**: `@process.value` is now `&.`-safe and rescues `Errno::ECHILD`, so a concurrent `close()` that already reaped the subprocess cannot crash the message loop.
- **Query read-loop cancellation**: `@task` now holds the actual `read_messages` child task. The previous outer-`Async`-wrapper assignment completed almost immediately after spawning, so `close`'s `@task.stop` never reached the actual read fiber and the loop only ended when the transport raised.
- **Query control-request leak**: `send_control_request` now cleans `@pending_control_*` entries in an `ensure` block and uses `Async::Task.current.with_timeout` instead of a nested `Async do ... end.wait`. An `Async::Stop` propagating through `.wait`, or a late `control_response` arriving after timeout, can no longer leak pending state.
- **Session forks dropped metadata**: `parse_fork_transcript` now filters transcript body by `TRANSCRIPT_TYPES` (`user`/`assistant`/`attachment`/`system`/`progress`). `custom-title`, `tag`, `aiTitle`, `permission-mode` and other metadata entries with the old sessionId no longer bleed into the forked transcript.
- **Session forks lost content-replacement history**: `content-replacement` entries are now accumulated across compaction rounds (concatenated) rather than overwritten, gated on matching `sessionId`. Forks emit `content-replacement` and `custom-title` entries with `uuid`+`timestamp` so a fork-of-a-fork can re-ingest them.
- **`delete_session` orphans**: also `FileUtils.rm_rf`s the sibling `<session-id>/` subagent transcript directory. Without this the CLI would later pick up stale subagent state if the same session ID happened to be reused.
- **`detect_worktrees` hang on stale git lock**: enforces a 5-second hard cap with `SIGKILL` fallback. `Timeout.timeout` is unsafe under the Async fiber scheduler (it raises across threads via `Thread#raise`), so the new implementation drains stdout/stderr on side threads and kills the child process if the deadline passes. A pipe-buffer-overrun edge case (enough worktrees to overrun the 64 KB pipe buffer) that previously silently lost every worktree path is also fixed.

## [0.16.7] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- `ClaudeAgentOptions#resume_session_at` — forwarded as `--resume-session-at <message-uuid>` to the CLI. When resuming a session, the conversation is truncated to include only messages up to and including the assistant message with the given UUID, enabling history rewriting / branched continuations from a specific turn. Raises `ArgumentError` from `CommandBuilder` if set without `resume` (matches the CLI's own validation but surfaces it synchronously in the caller's stack).
- `examples/e2b_transport_example.rb` — working ~320-line custom transport that runs the Claude Code CLI inside an E2B Firecracker microVM via the `e2b` gem. Reuses `CommandBuilder` for argv parity with `SubprocessCLITransport` and demonstrates the 6-method `Transport` interface against a remote backend. README's Custom Transport section now includes an interface table, data-flow diagram, code sketch, and production-hardening checklist that link to the example.

## [0.16.6] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- Type classes now accept hash construction with mixed key shapes — symbols or strings, snake_case or camelCase — and support bracket access (`obj[:field]`, `obj['field']`). `UserMessage.new({"sessionId" => "abc"})` works the same as `UserMessage.new(session_id: "abc")`. `Type.from_hash(nil)` and `Type.wrap(nil)` are nil-safe.
- `ClaudeAgentOptions.new(nil)` is accepted and yields an options object populated with configured defaults.

### Changed
- Discriminator fields on type classes (`type` on `SystemPromptFile`/`McpStdioServerConfig`/etc., `behavior` on `PermissionResultAllow`/`Deny`, `hook_event_name` on every hook input/output) are now `attr_reader`-only, set authoritatively in `initialize`. They cannot be overwritten externally.
- `ClaudeAgentOptions` continues to raise `ArgumentError` on unknown keys (constructor, `dup_with`, and `[]=`); other type subclasses silently drop unknown keys for forward-compatibility with newer CLI output.

### Internal
- Unified ~50 type classes (messages, hook inputs/outputs, MCP configs, system prompt configs, sandbox settings) under a shared `Type` base class. `lib/claude_agent_sdk/types.rb` shrank from 1510 to 588 lines; `MessageParser`'s system-message dispatch went from 215 lines to a 14-entry lookup table.

## [0.16.5] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `display:` option on `ThinkingConfigAdaptive` and `ThinkingConfigEnabled`, forwarded to the CLI as `--thinking-display <summarized|omitted>`. Opus 4.7 defaults thinking display to `"omitted"` (empty `thinking` field, signature only), so pass `ThinkingConfigAdaptive.new(display: "summarized")` to receive plaintext summarized thinking text. Invalid values raise `ArgumentError` at construction. See [adaptive thinking docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking).

### Internal
- Extracted private `writeln`/`write` helpers in `Client` and `Query` to consolidate the `@transport.write(json + "\n")` pattern across five call sites. Pure refactor; same bytes on the wire.

## [0.16.4] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `Client#receive_response` no longer hangs in interactive Client mode. The 0.16.1 flag-based fix relied on the loop draining via the transport's `:end` sentinel, which only arrives when the CLI subprocess exits — true for one-shot `query()` but never for a `Client` whose CLI stays alive between turns. `receive_response` now drives `QueryHandler#receive_messages` directly so its `break` runs on the same fiber as the underlying `Async::Queue#dequeue` loop and unwinds it. The 0.16.1 regression spec passed only because its stub iterated a finite array; replaced with a real `Async::Queue` driven from a sibling task so a hang now fails the test.

### Internal
- `FiberBoundary` doc-comment now warns that `break`/`return`/`next` cannot cross the thread hop, so SDK-internal loops yielding user callbacks must keep loop control on the outer side of the boundary.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Internal: extracted `SubprocessCLITransport#record_bounded_stderr` helper to deduplicate the recent-stderr ring-buffer append/trim logic shared by `handle_stderr` and `drain_stderr_with_accumulation`, and replaced the inlined `20` cap with a named `RECENT_STDERR_LINES_LIMIT` constant. No public behavior change.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Extracted `ClaudeAgentSDK::CommandBuilder` from `SubprocessCLITransport`. CLI argv assembly now lives in its own class and can be exercised in isolation — `CommandBuilder.new(cli_path, options).build` returns the argv array without booting a transport. No public behavior change; `SubprocessCLITransport#build_command` still works and now delegates to `CommandBuilder`.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `Client#receive_response` no longer raises `LocalJumpError: break from proc-closure` when called inside `Async { }`. The 0.15.1 thread-hop severed `break`'s unwind target; replaced with a flag so the loop exits via the natural `end` marker after `ResultMessage`.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **`#text` on every message type that carries content.** No more hand-rolling a `select { TextBlock }.map(&:text).join` in every consumer.
  - `AssistantMessage#text` — joins text across `TextBlock`s in the content array.
  - `UserMessage#text` — handles both String content (plain prompt) and Array-of-blocks content.
  - `SessionMessage#text` — joins text across parsed content blocks from a historical transcript.
  - `#to_s` on each message type is aliased to `#text`, so `puts message` and string interpolation just work.
  - Non-text blocks (`ToolUseBlock`, `ThinkingBlock`, `ToolResultBlock`, `UnknownBlock`) intentionally do **not** answer `#text` — only `TextBlock` is textual. The message helpers use `Array#grep(TextBlock)` to select text blocks.
- **`SessionMessage#content_blocks`** returns typed block objects (`TextBlock`, `ThinkingBlock`, `ToolUseBlock`, `ToolResultBlock`, `UnknownBlock`) instead of the raw hash blocks from the JSONL transcript. Unknown block types become `UnknownBlock` for forward compatibility with newer CLI versions.

### Changed
- Rails Integration / Quick Start / Observability / File Checkpointing README examples dropped the `content.select { is_a?(TextBlock) }.map(&:text).join` dance in favor of `message.text`.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Thread-keyed libraries are now safe inside SDK callbacks.** The SDK internally hops to a plain thread at every user-callback boundary — blocks passed to `ClaudeAgentSDK.query` / `Client#receive_messages`, SDK MCP tool handlers, hooks, permission callbacks, and observer methods — so the `async` gem's Fiber scheduler is no longer visible to user code. Previously, any library that keys state on `Thread.current` (ActiveRecord and every DB driver keyed by thread — `pg`, `mysql2`, `sqlite3` — plus per-thread HTTP/cache pools, request stores, etc.) could be corrupted by the scheduler interleaving two fibers onto one checked-out connection. Rails/Sidekiq/Kamal consumers no longer need a caller-side wrapper to avoid this. See the "Thread-keyed libraries are safe inside SDK callbacks" subsection under Rails Integration in the README.

### Changed
- **Callbacks run on a plain thread, not inside `Async::Task`.** Fiber-specific primitives (e.g. `Async::Task.current.sleep`, `Async::Task.current.async { ... }`) are no longer available inside tool handlers, hooks, permission callbacks, message blocks, or observers. Callbacks that want cooperative concurrency can open their own `Async { }` block. In practice callbacks do ordinary Ruby work and return a value, so this rarely affects real code.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

#### Protocol & CLI
- `--setting-sources` is now only emitted when the option is explicitly configured. Previously every invocation sent `--setting-sources ""`, which the CLI can interpret as "no setting sources" rather than "use defaults", overriding the CLI's own source resolution.
- `extra_args` flag names are validated against a lowercase kebab-case pattern and raise `ArgumentError` otherwise. Prevents option injection from multi-tenant configs (e.g. an attacker-controlled hash injecting `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` and relying on CLI last-wins to defeat SDK-chosen safety).

#### Concurrency
- `SubprocessCLITransport#close` replaced `Timeout.timeout` with Async-safe polling on `@process.alive?`. Stdlib `Timeout.timeout` raises via `Thread#raise`, which can corrupt fiber-scheduler state when `close` runs inside the Async reactor. Still raises `Timeout::Error` so existing rescue clauses keep working.
- Inbound `control_request` handlers are now spawned as children of the current read task via `Async::Task.current.async`. Bare `Async do` had ambiguous parent linkage; `@task.stop` could leave handler tasks writing to a closed transport.

#### Sessions
- `list_sessions` and `get_session_messages` coerce `offset: nil` to 0. Previously callers splatting from an options hash crashed on `nil.positive?` / `messages[nil..]`.
- `fork_session` streams the source JSONL via `File.foreach` instead of `File.read`, and scrubs non-UTF-8 bytes on each line. Fixes `Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError` on stray bytes in tool output and avoids slurping sessions that can reach hundreds of MB.
- `simple_hash` (used for project-dir hashing) now iterates UTF-16 code units to match JavaScript's `charCodeAt`. Previously `each_char` + `ord` diverged from the official tools for supplementary characters (emoji, CJK extensions), so paths containing them hashed to different project directories and silently returned no sessions.

#### Security
- Replaced shell backticks with `Open3.capture3` (array args) in worktree detection. The path argument was already `Shellwords.escape`d, but running via `/bin/sh` leaves a latent shell-injection surface — any future interpolation without escaping would be exploitable.

### Changed
- `derive_fork_title` helper is now `private_class_method`, matching its siblings on `SessionMutations`.



### Added
- **`EFFORT_LEVELS` constant** exposing `%w[low medium high xhigh max]`. Consumers can reference `ClaudeAgentSDK::EFFORT_LEVELS` for validation instead of hard-coding the list.
- **`xhigh` effort level**: documented in the SDK to match the Claude Code CLI (2.1.111+). Supported on Opus 4.7; the CLI auto-falls-back to the highest supported level on older models (e.g. `xhigh` → `high` on Opus 4.6).

### Changed
- Inline comments and README updated to reference `ClaudeAgentSDK::EFFORT_LEVELS` rather than a stale hard-coded level list.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Thinking configuration**: Use `--thinking adaptive` / `--thinking disabled` CLI flags instead of mapping to `--max-thinking-tokens`. Previously, `ThinkingConfigAdaptive` was mapped to `--max-thinking-tokens 32000` (fixed budget) and `ThinkingConfigDisabled` to `--max-thinking-tokens 0`, which put the CLI into the wrong mode. Only `ThinkingConfigEnabled` now uses `--max-thinking-tokens`. (Parity with [Python SDK #796](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/796))

### Added
- **`exclude_dynamic_sections`** on `SystemPromptPreset`: When set to `true`, the CLI strips per-user dynamic sections (working directory, auto-memory, git status) from the preset system prompt and re-injects them into the first user message. This makes the system prompt byte-identical across users, enabling cross-user prompt-caching hits. Sent via `excludeDynamicSections` in the initialize control message; older CLIs silently ignore it. (Parity with [Python SDK #797](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/797))

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-08 — Python SDK v0.1.51–0.1.56 Parity

### Added

#### Type Completeness
- `AssistantMessage`: `message_id`, `stop_reason`, `session_id`, `uuid` fields (populated from CLI message data)
- `AgentDefinition`: `disallowed_tools`, `max_turns`, `initial_prompt`, `background`, `effort`, `permission_mode` fields (serialized to CLI via initialize request)
- `ToolPermissionContext`: `tool_use_id`, `agent_id` fields for distinguishing parallel permission requests and sub-agent context
- `PERMISSION_MODES`: added `dontAsk` and `auto` values

#### New Types and Options
- `SystemPromptFile` class — loads system prompt from a file path via `--system-prompt-file` CLI flag
- `TaskBudget` class — API-side token budget, passed as `--task-budget` CLI flag
- `ForkSessionResult` class — returned by `fork_session()` with the new session ID
- `session_id` option on `ClaudeAgentOptions` — specify a custom session ID via `--session-id` CLI flag
- `task_budget` option on `ClaudeAgentOptions`

#### Session Management
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.delete_session(session_id:, directory:)` — hard-deletes a session JSONL file
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.fork_session(session_id:, directory:, up_to_message_id:, title:)` — filesystem-level fork with UUID remapping, sidechain filtering, content-replacement forwarding, and auto-generated titles
- `offset` parameter on `ClaudeAgentSDK.list_sessions` for cursor-based pagination

#### Client Introspection
- `Client#get_context_usage` / `Query#get_context_usage` — sends `get_context_usage` control request for context window breakdown (tokens by category, model, MCP tools, memory files, etc.)

#### MCP Robustness
- `SdkMcpTool#meta` field and `_meta` forwarding in `tools/list` responses — prevents silent truncation of large tool results (>50K chars) by forwarding `anthropic/maxResultSizeChars` through the MCP `_meta` field
- `create_tool` auto-populates `_meta` from `annotations[:maxResultSizeChars]` when present

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- Handle `ProcessError` when CLI exits non-zero after delivering a valid result (e.g., StructuredOutput `tool_use` triggers exit code 1). Previously this propagated as a fatal error; now it is suppressed when a result was already received.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

#### Observer Interface
- `Observer` module with `on_user_prompt`, `on_message`, `on_error`, `on_close` — all with no-op defaults
- `observers` option on `ClaudeAgentOptions` (default `[]`) — register observers for both `query()` and `Client`
- `resolve_observers` supports callable factories (lambdas) for thread-safe global defaults in Rails/Puma/Sidekiq
- `notify_observers` rescues per-observer errors so observers never crash the main pipeline

#### OpenTelemetry Instrumentation
- `ClaudeAgentSDK::Instrumentation::OTelObserver` — emits spans using `gen_ai.*` and OpenInference semantic conventions
- Span tree: `claude_agent.session` (root) → `claude_agent.generation` + `claude_agent.tool.*` (children)
- `langfuse.observation.type` set on all spans (`agent`/`generation`/`tool`) to enable Langfuse trace flow diagram
- `input.value`/`output.value` (OpenInference) for Langfuse Preview Input/Output fields
- `llm.token_count.*`, `llm.cost.total`, `llm.model_name` for full Langfuse cost/usage tracking
- `openinference.span.kind` (`AGENT`/`LLM`/`TOOL`) on all spans
- Events: `api_retry`, `rate_limit`, `tool_progress` recorded on root span
- Lazy `require 'opentelemetry'` — zero cost for users who don't use it

#### Examples
- `otel_langfuse_example.rb` — Langfuse-via-OTel setup with OTLP exporter
- `test_langfuse_otel.rb` — multi-tool integration test (Bash tool calls)

### Changed
- README: added Observability section with Langfuse setup guide, span attribute reference, custom observer example, Rails initializer patterns
- README: split sandbox into CLI settings vs sandbox-runtime rows in comparison table
- README: updated recommended gem version to `~> 0.13.0`
- CLAUDE.md: documented observer/instrumentation architecture

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-01

Full Claude Code parity release — cross-referenced against the Claude Code source (`coreSchemas.ts`) and TypeScript SDK to bring every message type, hook event, and sandbox setting into the Ruby SDK.

### Added

#### All 24 Message Types (full CLI parity)
- `InitMessage` — session start / `/clear` with uuid, session_id, agents, api_key_source, betas, claude_code_version, cwd, tools, mcp_servers, model, permission_mode, slash_commands, output_style, skills, plugins, fast_mode_state
- `CompactBoundaryMessage` — context compaction with uuid, session_id, compact_metadata (pre_tokens, trigger, preserved_segment)
- `StatusMessage` — compacting status, permission mode changes
- `APIRetryMessage` — attempt, max_retries, retry_delay_ms, error_status, error
- `LocalCommandOutputMessage` — local command output content
- `HookStartedMessage`, `HookProgressMessage`, `HookResponseMessage` — hook lifecycle with hook_id, hook_name, hook_event, stdout, stderr, output, exit_code, outcome
- `SessionStateChangedMessage` — idle/running/requires_action state
- `FilesPersistedMessage` — files, failed, processed_at
- `ElicitationCompleteMessage` — MCP elicitation completion
- `ToolProgressMessage` — per-tool elapsed time tracking (type: `tool_progress`)
- `AuthStatusMessage` — authentication status (type: `auth_status`)
- `ToolUseSummaryMessage` — tool use summaries (type: `tool_use_summary`)
- `PromptSuggestionMessage` — predicted next prompts (type: `prompt_suggestion`)

#### All 27 Hook Events (full CLI parity)
- New hook input types: `SessionStartHookInput`, `SessionEndHookInput`, `StopFailureHookInput`, `PostCompactHookInput`, `PermissionDeniedHookInput`, `SetupHookInput`, `TeammateIdleHookInput`, `TaskCreatedHookInput`, `TaskCompletedHookInput`, `ElicitationHookInput`, `ElicitationResultHookInput`, `ConfigChangeHookInput`, `InstructionsLoadedHookInput`, `CwdChangedHookInput`, `FileChangedHookInput`, `WorktreeCreateHookInput`, `WorktreeRemoveHookInput`
- New hook specific output types: `SetupHookSpecificOutput`, `PermissionDeniedHookSpecificOutput`, `CwdChangedHookSpecificOutput`, `FileChangedHookSpecificOutput`
- `StopHookInput` and `SubagentStopHookInput` now include `last_assistant_message`

#### Bare Mode
- `bare: true` option on `ClaudeAgentOptions` — sugar for `--bare` CLI flag (skips hooks, LSP, plugin sync, CLAUDE.md auto-discovery, auto-memory, keychain reads)

#### Full Sandbox Settings (CC parity)
- `SandboxFilesystemConfig` — new class with allow_write, deny_write, deny_read, allow_read, allow_managed_read_paths_only
- `SandboxNetworkConfig` — added allowed_domains, allow_managed_domains_only
- `SandboxSettings` — added fail_if_unavailable, filesystem, enable_weaker_network_isolation, ripgrep
- `ignore_violations` now accepts a plain Hash (matching CC's `Record<string, string[]>`)
- Removed `SandboxIgnoreViolations` class (CC uses generic hash, not typed struct)

#### Expanded Existing Types
- `ResultMessage` — added uuid, fast_mode_state, model_usage, permission_denials, errors
- `TaskStartedMessage` — added workflow_name, prompt
- `TaskProgressMessage` — added summary
- `CompactMetadata` — added preserved_segment
- `ASSISTANT_MESSAGE_ERRORS` — added max_output_tokens

#### Session Browsing
- `get_session_info(session_id:, directory:)` — single-session metadata lookup without scanning full directory
- `SDKSessionInfo` — added tag, created_at fields; improved title/summary extraction

#### Examples
- `message_types_example.rb` — comprehensive handler for all 24 message types
- `lifecycle_hooks_example.rb` — all 27 hook events with typed inputs/outputs
- `bare_mode_example.rb` — minimal startup patterns
- `sandbox_example.rb` — full sandbox config (network, filesystem, violations)

### Fixed
- Graceful subprocess shutdown: wait before SIGTERM to avoid race conditions
- `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` uses default-if-absent semantics (doesn't override caller env)
- Pre-existing `Time.zone` spec failures in sessions_spec.rb
- Pre-existing `File.open` without block in session_mutations.rb

### Changed
- README restructured: positioned as community Ruby SDK (not Python mirror), 3-way comparison table (TS/Python/Ruby), links to official SDKs
- Skill updated to cover all new types and hook events

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

#### Custom Transport Support
- `Client.new` accepts `transport_class:` and `transport_args:` keyword arguments, allowing consumers to plug in custom transports (e.g., E2B sandbox, remote SSH) without duplicating `Client#connect` internals
- Default remains `SubprocessCLITransport` — zero behavior change for existing callers
- Custom transport class must implement the `Transport` interface (`connect`, `write`, `read_messages`, `end_input`, `close`, `ready?`)
- `transport_args` are passed as keyword arguments to `transport_class.new(options, **transport_args)`
- All option transformations, MCP extraction, hook conversion, and Query lifecycle stay in `Client#connect` — the transport only handles I/O

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-20

Port of Python SDK v0.1.48 features for feature parity.

### Added

#### Session Mutations
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.rename_session(session_id:, title:, directory:)` — rename a session by appending a custom-title JSONL entry
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.tag_session(session_id:, tag:, directory:)` — tag a session (pass `nil` to clear); tags are Unicode-sanitized
- `SessionMutations` module with `rename_session`, `tag_session`, and internal Unicode sanitization helpers
- Ported from Python SDK's `_internal/session_mutations.py` with TOCTOU-safe `O_WRONLY | O_APPEND` file operations

#### AssistantMessage Usage
- `usage` attribute on `AssistantMessage` — token usage data from the API response
- `MessageParser` populates `usage` from `data.dig(:message, :usage)`

#### AgentDefinition Fields
- `skills`, `memory`, `mcp_servers` attributes on `AgentDefinition`
- Serialized as `skills`, `memory`, `mcpServers` (camelCase) in the CLI wire protocol initialize request

#### TaskUsage Typed Class
- `TaskUsage` class with `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms` attributes
- `TaskUsage.from_hash` factory supporting symbol, string, camelCase, and snake_case keys

### Removed

#### FGTS Environment Variable
- Removed auto-setting of `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FINE_GRAINED_TOOL_STREAMING` environment variable when `include_partial_messages` is enabled — Python SDK v0.1.48 reverted this because it causes HTTP 400 errors on LiteLLM proxies, Bedrock, and Vertex with Claude 4.5 models. The `--include-partial-messages` CLI flag remains the correct mechanism.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-12

Port of Python SDK v0.1.48 parity improvements.

### Added

#### Typed Rate Limit Events
- `RateLimitInfo` class with `status`, `resets_at`, `rate_limit_type`, `utilization`, `overage_status`, `overage_resets_at`, `overage_disabled_reason`, `raw` attributes
- `RATE_LIMIT_STATUSES` constant (`allowed`, `allowed_warning`, `rejected`)
- `RATE_LIMIT_TYPES` constant (`five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `overage`)
- `RateLimitEvent` now has typed `rate_limit_info`, `uuid`, `session_id` attributes (previously raw `data` hash)
- Backward-compatible `data` accessor on `RateLimitEvent` returns raw hash from `rate_limit_info.raw`

#### MCP Status Output Types
- `McpClaudeAIProxyServerConfig` type for `claudeai-proxy` servers in MCP status responses
- `McpSdkServerConfigStatus` type for serializable SDK server config in status responses
- `McpServerStatus.parse` handles `claudeai-proxy` config type

#### Effort Level
- `effort` option now supports `"max"` value in addition to `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-08

Python SDK parity fixes for one-shot `query()` control protocol and CLI transport.

### Fixed

#### One-Shot Query Control Protocol
- **Hooks and `can_use_tool` in `query()`:** One-shot `query()` now passes `hooks`, `can_use_tool`, and SDK MCP servers through to the `Query` handler, matching the Python SDK (previously these were Client-only)
- **`can_use_tool` validation:** String prompts with `can_use_tool` now raise `ArgumentError` (streaming mode required); conflicting `permission_prompt_tool_name` also raises early
- **`session_id` parity:** One-shot queries now send `session_id: ''` (was `'default'`), matching Python SDK behavior
- **Premature stdin close:** Added `wait_for_result_and_end_input` that holds stdin open until the first result when hooks or SDK MCP servers need control message exchange
- **`stream_input` stdin leak:** Moved `end_input` to `ensure` block so stdin is always closed even when the stream enumerator raises
- **`Async::Condition` race:** Added `@first_result_received` flag guard to prevent lost signals when result arrives before `wait` is called

#### CLI Transport Parity
- **File checkpointing:** Moved from deprecated `--enable-file-checkpointing` CLI flag to `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_SDK_FILE_CHECKPOINTING` environment variable
- **Partial messages:** Now also sets `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FINE_GRAINED_TOOL_STREAMING=1` environment variable when `include_partial_messages` is enabled
- **Tools preset:** `ToolsPreset` objects and preset hashes now map to `--tools default` (was `--tools <json>`)
- **Plugins:** Changed from `--plugins <json>` to `--plugin-dir <path>` per-plugin, matching current CLI interface
- **Plugin type:** `SdkPluginConfig` now defaults to `type: 'local'` (was `'plugin'`), normalizes legacy `'plugin'` type
- **Rewind control request:** Changed key from `userMessageUuid` to `user_message_id` for Python SDK parity
- **Settings file with sandbox:** When sandbox is enabled and settings is a file path, now reads and parses the file to merge sandbox settings (raises on missing/invalid files instead of silently dropping settings)

#### Hook Input Parsing
- **Falsy value preservation:** `parse_hook_input` now uses `key?`-based lookup instead of `||`, correctly preserving `false` and `nil` values (e.g., `stop_hook_active: false`)
- **Empty hooks normalization:** `query()` now skips empty matcher lists and normalizes hooks to `nil` when no matchers survive, preventing unnecessary 60s close-wait timeout

### Changed
- **`build_command` refactored:** Extracted `build_settings_args`, `build_tools_args`, `build_output_format_args`, `build_mcp_servers_args`, `build_plugins_args` private helpers to reduce method complexity

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-05

Port of Python SDK v0.1.46 features.

### Added

#### Task Message Types
- `TaskStartedMessage`, `TaskProgressMessage`, `TaskNotificationMessage` — typed `SystemMessage` subclasses for background task lifecycle events
- `TASK_NOTIFICATION_STATUSES` constant (`completed`, `failed`, `stopped`)
- `MessageParser` dispatches on `subtype` within `system` messages, falling back to generic `SystemMessage` for unknown subtypes

#### MCP Server Control
- `reconnect_mcp_server(server_name)` on `Query` and `Client` — retry failed MCP server connections
- `toggle_mcp_server(server_name, enabled)` on `Query` and `Client` — enable/disable MCP servers live
- `stop_task(task_id)` on `Query` and `Client` — stop a running background task

#### Subagent Context on Hook Inputs
- `agent_id` and `agent_type` attributes on `PreToolUseHookInput`, `PostToolUseHookInput`, `PostToolUseFailureHookInput`, `PermissionRequestHookInput`
- Populated when hooks fire inside subagents, allowing attribution of tool calls to specific agents

#### Result Message
- `stop_reason` attribute on `ResultMessage` (e.g., `'end_turn'`, `'max_tokens'`, `'stop_sequence'`)

#### Typed MCP Status Response
- `McpServerInfo`, `McpToolAnnotations`, `McpToolInfo`, `McpServerStatus`, `McpStatusResponse` types
- `.parse` class methods for hydrating from raw CLI response hashes
- `MCP_SERVER_CONNECTION_STATUSES` constant (`connected`, `failed`, `needs-auth`, `pending`, `disabled`)

#### Session Browsing
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.list_sessions(directory:, limit:, include_worktrees:)` — list sessions from `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL files
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.get_session_messages(session_id:, directory:, limit:, offset:)` — reconstruct conversation chain from session transcript
- `SDKSessionInfo` type with `session_id`, `summary`, `last_modified`, `file_size`, `custom_title`, `first_prompt`, `git_branch`, `cwd`
- `SessionMessage` type with `type`, `uuid`, `session_id`, `message`
- Pure filesystem operations — no CLI subprocess required
- Git worktree-aware session scanning
- `parentUuid` chain walking with cycle detection for robust conversation reconstruction

### Fixed
- **`McpToolAnnotations.parse` losing `false` values:** `readOnly: false` was evaluated as `false || nil → nil` due to `||` short-circuiting. Now uses `.key?` to check presence before falling back to snake_case keys.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **String-keyed JSON schema crash:** Libraries like [RubyLLM](https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm) that deep-stringify schema keys (e.g., `{ 'type' => 'object', 'properties' => { ... } }`) were misidentified as simple type-mapping schemas, causing each top-level key to be treated as a parameter name instead of passing the schema through. Now both symbol-keyed and string-keyed schemas are detected and normalized correctly. (PR #9 by [@iuhoay](https://github.com/iuhoay))
- **Shallow key symbolization:** `convert_schema` used `transform_keys` (shallow) which left nested property keys as strings, breaking downstream `MCP::Tool::InputSchema` construction. Now uses deep symbolization recursively.
- **Guard ordering crash:** `convert_schema` and `convert_input_schema` accessed `schema[:type]` before the `schema.is_a?(Hash)` guard, which would raise `NoMethodError` on `nil` input.
- **Schema detection tightened:** Pre-built schema detection now requires `type == 'object'` and `properties.is_a?(Hash)`, preventing false positives when a simple schema happens to have parameters named `type` and `properties`.

### Added
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.deep_symbolize_keys` utility method for recursive hash key symbolization

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Unknown content block crash:** Unrecognized content block types (e.g., `document` blocks from PDF reading) now return `UnknownBlock` instead of raising `MessageParseError`, aligning with the Python SDK's forward-compatible design
- **Unknown message type crash:** Unrecognized message types now return `nil` (skipped by callers) instead of raising
- **Empty input schema crash:** Tools with no parameters (`input_schema: {}`) caused `MCP::Tool::InputSchema` validation failure (`required` array must have at least 1 item per JSON Schema draft-04). Now omits `required` when empty.

### Added
- `UnknownBlock` type that preserves raw data for unrecognized content block types

### Changed
- **Breaking (minor):** `MessageParser.parse` no longer raises `MessageParseError` for unknown message types — returns `nil` instead. If you were rescuing `MessageParseError` to handle unknown types, check for `nil` return values instead.
- **Breaking (minor):** `MessageParser.parse_content_block` no longer raises `MessageParseError` for unknown content block types — returns `UnknownBlock` instead. Content block iteration using `is_a?` filtering (e.g., `block.is_a?(TextBlock)`) is unaffected.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Transport initialization crash:** `SubprocessCLITransport#initialize` used raw `options` parameter instead of resolved `@options` on lines 19, 20, 27 — caused `NoMethodError: undefined method 'cli_path' for nil` when using single-arg form (how `Client.new` calls it)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

#### Thinking Configuration
- `ThinkingConfigAdaptive`, `ThinkingConfigEnabled`, `ThinkingConfigDisabled` classes for structured thinking control
- `thinking` option on `ClaudeAgentOptions` — takes precedence over deprecated `max_thinking_tokens`
  - `ThinkingConfigAdaptive` → 32,000 token default budget
  - `ThinkingConfigEnabled(budget_tokens:)` → explicit budget
  - `ThinkingConfigDisabled` → 0 tokens (thinking off)
- `effort` option on `ClaudeAgentOptions` — maps to `--effort` CLI flag (`'low'`, `'medium'`, `'high'`)

#### Tool Annotations
- `annotations` attribute on `SdkMcpTool` for MCP tool annotations (e.g., `readOnlyHint`, `title`)
- `annotations:` keyword on `ClaudeAgentSDK.create_tool`
- Annotations included in `SdkMcpServer#list_tools` responses

#### Hook Enhancements
- `tool_use_id` attribute on `PreToolUseHookInput` and `PostToolUseHookInput`
- `additional_context` attribute on `PreToolUseHookSpecificOutput`

#### Message Enhancements
- `tool_use_result` attribute on `UserMessage` for tool response data
- `MessageParser` populates `tool_use_result` from CLI output

### Changed

#### Architecture: Always Streaming Mode (BREAKING for internal API)
- **`SubprocessCLITransport`** now always uses `--input-format stream-json` — removed `--print` mode and `--agents` CLI flag
- **`SubprocessCLITransport.new`** still accepts `(prompt, options)` for compatibility but ignores the prompt argument (always uses streaming mode)
- **`query()`** now uses the full control protocol internally (Query handler + initialize handshake), matching the Python SDK
- **Agents** are sent via the `initialize` control request over stdin instead of CLI `--agents` flag, avoiding OS ARG_MAX limits
- **`query()`** now supports SDK MCP servers and `can_use_tool` callbacks (previously Client-only)

#### Empty System Prompt
- When `system_prompt` is `nil`, passes `--system-prompt ""` to CLI for predictable behavior without the default Claude Code system prompt

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **ProcessError stderr:** Real stderr output is now included in `ProcessError` exceptions (was always "No stderr output captured")
- **Rate limit events:** Added `RateLimitEvent` type and `rate_limit_event` message parsing support

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **Large prompt `Errno::E2BIG` crash:** Prompts exceeding 200KB are now piped via stdin instead of passed as CLI arguments, avoiding the OS `ARG_MAX` limit (typically 1MB on macOS/Linux). This fixes `CLIConnectionError: Failed to start Claude Code: Argument list too long` when using `query()` with large prompts.
- **Stderr pipe deadlock (`Errno::EPIPE`):** Always drain stderr in a background thread, even when `stderr` option is not set. Without this, `--verbose` output fills the 64KB OS pipe buffer, the subprocess blocks on write, and all pipes stall. Previously only manifested with long-running Opus sessions.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Configurable control request timeout:** New `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_CONTROL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment variable (default 1200s) for tuning the control protocol timeout — essential for long-running agent sessions and agent teams
- **`ControlRequestTimeoutError`:** Dedicated error class (`< CLIConnectionError`) raised on control request timeouts, enabling typed exception handling instead of string matching

### Fixed
- **camelCase `requestId` fallback:** All control message routing (`read_messages`, `handle_control_response`, `handle_control_request`) now tolerates both `request_id` and `requestId` keys from the CLI
- **Outbound `requestId` parity:** Control requests and responses now include both `request_id` and `requestId` for maximum CLI compatibility
- **Pending request unblocking:** Transport errors now signal all pending control request conditions, preventing callers from hanging until timeout
- **Error object in message queue:** `read_messages` rescue now enqueues the exception object (not just `e.message`), preserving error class for typed handling
- **Thread-safe CLI discovery:** `find_cli` uses `Open3.capture2` instead of backtick shell for thread safety
- **Robust process cleanup:** `close` now uses SIGTERM → 2s grace period → SIGKILL escalation (was immediate SIGTERM with no fallback), handles `Errno::ESRCH` for already-dead processes, and logs cleanup warnings instead of silently swallowing errors

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Default configuration:** `ClaudeAgentSDK.configure` block for setting default options that merge with every `ClaudeAgentOptions` instance, ideal for Rails initializers (PR #8)
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.reset_configuration` for resetting defaults (useful in tests)
- Deep merge for `env` and `mcp_servers` hashes; provided values override configured defaults
- `OPTION_DEFAULTS` constant on `ClaudeAgentOptions` for introspectable non-nil defaults

### Changed
- `ClaudeAgentOptions#initialize` now uses `**kwargs` internally to correctly distinguish caller-provided values from method signature defaults

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **MCP response fidelity:** Non-text content (images, binary data) is now preserved in SDK MCP tool responses instead of being silently dropped
- **MCP error key:** Tool error flag is now sent as `isError` (camelCase) matching the JSON-RPC spec, instead of `is_error` which the CLI ignored
- **MCP structured content:** `structuredContent` is now passed through in tool responses
- **ENV pollution:** `query()` and `Client.connect` no longer mutate the global `ENV`; entrypoint is passed via transport options
- **Symbol key env:** Fixed symbol keys in `env` option causing spawn failures (PR #7)

### Added
- `ClaudeAgentSDK.flexible_fetch` helper for tolerant hash key lookup (symbol/string, camelCase/snake_case)
- Gated real CLI integration tests (`RUN_REAL_INTEGRATION=1`) with budget cap
- `CLAUDE.md` architecture guide for contributors

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-05

### Added

#### Hook Parity
- Added hook event support for `PostToolUseFailure`, `Notification`, `SubagentStart`, and `PermissionRequest`
- Expanded `SubagentStop` hook inputs with `agent_id`, `agent_transcript_path`, and `agent_type`
- Added hook-specific outputs for new hook events
- Added `updatedMCPToolOutput` support to `PostToolUse` hook outputs

#### MCP Status APIs
- `get_mcp_status` on `Query` and `Client` for live MCP connection status (streaming mode)
- `get_server_info` on `Client` as a parity alias for server initialization info

### Fixed
- Hook input parsing now supports both symbol and string keys
- Hook callback timeouts are enforced and control request cancellation is handled cleanly

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added

#### File Checkpointing & Rewind
- `enable_file_checkpointing` option in `ClaudeAgentOptions` for enabling file state checkpointing
- `rewind_files(user_message_uuid)` method on `Query` and `Client` classes
- `uuid` field on `UserMessage` for tracking message identifiers for rewind support

#### Beta Features Support
- `SDK_BETAS` constant with available beta features (e.g., `"context-1m-2025-08-07"`)
- `betas` option in `ClaudeAgentOptions` for enabling beta features

#### Tools Configuration
- `tools` option for base tools selection (separate from `allowed_tools`)
- Supports array of tool names, empty array `[]`, or `ToolsPreset` object
- `ToolsPreset` class for preset-based tool configuration
- `append_allowed_tools` option to append tools to the allowed list

#### Sandbox Settings
- `SandboxSettings` class for isolated command execution configuration
- `SandboxNetworkConfig` class for network isolation settings
- `SandboxIgnoreViolations` class for configuring violation handling
- `sandbox` option in `ClaudeAgentOptions` for sandbox configuration
- Automatic merging of sandbox settings into the main settings JSON

#### Additional Types
- `SystemPromptPreset` class for preset-based system prompts

### Technical Details
- All new CLI flags properly passed to Claude Code subprocess
- Sandbox settings merged into `--settings` JSON for CLI compatibility
- UserMessage UUID parsed from CLI output for rewind support

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-17
