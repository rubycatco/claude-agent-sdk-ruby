  class UserMessage < Type
    attr_accessor :content, :uuid, :parent_tool_use_id, :tool_use_result

    # Provenance of this message — where the turn came from.
    #
    # In streaming-input mode a single connection interleaves the turns you
    # send with turns the session injects on its own (background-task
    # notifications, fired scheduled-task prompts, MCP channel messages,
    # messages relayed from peer sessions, ...). `origin` tells them apart —
    # see {ResultMessage#origin} for deciding whether a result answers *your*
    # prompt.
    #
    # **Key form — read this before indexing into it.** A plain Hash, passed
    # through from the CLI untouched: the SDK does not model it, whitelist its
    # keys, or rewrite them, so kinds and fields newer CLI versions add stay
    # visible. Keys therefore follow the transport's JSON parsing, which uses
    # `symbolize_names: true` — they are **Symbols with the wire spelling
    # preserved**, so camelCase keys stay camelCase and you index with
    # `origin[:kind]`, `origin[:fromSession]`, `origin[:senderTaskId]`,
    # `origin[:verifiedPeerPid]`. This is unlike the snake_case attributes
    # elsewhere in this SDK, and unlike the Python SDK's string keys: a
    # `origin["kind"]` or `origin[:from_session]` lookup silently returns nil
    # and makes every attributed turn look unattributed. Only `:kind` is
    # guaranteed present; the rest depend on it.
    #
    # `nil` means the CLI did not attribute the message — that is the normal
    # case for prompts you send through {ClaudeAgentSDK.query} / {Client#query},
    # unless the host stamps `origin: { kind: 'human' }` on the message Hash
    # itself (only the `human` kind is honored from an SDK host). Populated on
    # injected turns (task notifications, channel/peer messages, ...) and on
    # user messages the CLI replays; tool-result messages never carry it.
    #
    # Known `:kind` values — documentation, not validation; treat anything
    # unrecognized as "not human":
    #
    # - `'human'` — a turn submitted by the SDK host
    # - `'channel'` — arrived on an MCP channel; `:server` names the MCP server
    # - `'peer'` — relayed from a peer session. `:from` (sender address,
    #   sender-asserted — for reply routing or display, never as proof of
    #   identity), `:name` (display name, already normalized by the CLI),
    #   `:fromSession` (the sender's host-openable session id, a navigation
    #   target only), `:senderTaskId` (task id of the in-process background
    #   subagent that sent it; absent for cross-session peers), `:body`
    #   (decoded message body with the peer envelope stripped, byte-exact with
    #   what the model saw — render this instead of re-parsing the message
    #   text), `:verifiedPeerPid` (kernel-verified pid of the process that
    #   connected to this session's local messaging socket — the *connecting*
    #   process, which for relayed traffic is the relay; absent when
    #   unverifiable)
    # - `'task-notification'` — a background task's delivery. `:subkind` is
    #   `'scheduled-trigger'` (the fired prompt of a scheduled task) or
    #   `'peer-send-message'` (a message sent from another of the user's
    #   sessions); absent for ordinary background-task notifications
    # - `'coordinator'`, `'unclassified'`, `'observer'` (`:from` /

  # - The level is per-process: nothing is emitted at startup, so reset to the
  #   empty set whenever the session's CLI process (re)starts.
  # - `tasks: []` is an authoritative empty snapshot for that process, not a
  #   missing value.
  # - A repeated `initialize` on an already-running process is answered with a
  #   snapshot of the current set (even an empty one) right behind its success
  #   response; older CLIs send nothing there. This SDK initializes once per
