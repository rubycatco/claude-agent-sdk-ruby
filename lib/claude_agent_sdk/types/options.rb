    # With {#resume_session_at}: the UUID of the user prompt whose turn this
    # truncating resume intends to discard.
    #
    # When set, the CLI validates at load time that every transcript entry
    # after the `resume_session_at` point is attributable to that turn, and
    # refuses the resume otherwise — e.g. when the discarded range contains a
    # queued user message or task notification the session absorbed mid-turn
    # that the caller had not yet observed. Leave unset to keep the
    # unvalidated truncation behavior.
    #
    # **Choosing the fork point.** Set `resume_session_at` to the *last*
    # transcript entry of the turn you are keeping — whatever its type — and
    # `resume_drops_turn` to the prompt UUID of the turn immediately after it
    # (e.g. the next `SessionMessage` of `type == "user"` from
    # {ClaudeAgentSDK.get_session_messages}, or the `uuid` you supplied on a
    # streamed user message). Note that with structured output
    # ({#output_format}) or end-turn MCP tools a kept turn ends on entries
    # *after* its last assistant message, so forking at the assistant UUID is
    # refused by design.
    #
    # **On refusal.** The CLI reports an `error_during_execution` result whose
    # message starts with `Resume rejected by --resume-drops-turn:` — match on

    # When true, every user message the SDK sends is marked `client_composed`:
    # a String prompt to {ClaudeAgentSDK.query}, {Client#connect} or
    # {Client#query}, and every message of a streamed (Enumerable) prompt to
    # any of them. Claude Code then delivers the text exactly as given: no
    # `@path` file-mention expansion and no slash-command dispatch. Use it when
    # the prompt is assembled from content your end user did not type (earlier
    # turns, tool output, third-party text), so an `@/absolute/path` inside it
    # cannot make Claude Code read a local file. `tools: []`, `allowed_tools`
    # and `disallowed_tools` do not stop that expansion: it happens before the
    # model runs, without a tool call.
    #
    # While the option is on there is no per-message opt-out: a
    # `client_composed` key on a streamed message Hash (either spelling) is
    # overwritten. For per-turn control, leave the option off and set
    # `client_composed: true` on individual streamed messages. The caller's
    # Hashes are never mutated. A streamed JSONL String is parsed, marked and
    # re-serialized; one that is not a single JSON object raises
    # `ArgumentError` rather than being sent unmarked (on the background
    # streaming paths that ends the stream with a warning, like any other
    # stream error).
    #
    # On current Claude Code versions a turn delivered this way also skips the
    # turn-start attachment pass as a whole: `@server:resource` MCP mentions
    # are not expanded either, and the prompt goes without the context Claude
    # Code normally attaches (nested `CLAUDE.md` and rules files, skill and
    # tool listings, other per-turn reminders). The pass between tool calls is
    # unaffected, so most of that context arrives after the turn's first tool
    # call instead.
    #
    # Requires Claude Code 2.1.248 or later; older versions ignore the field,
    # so prompts are still expanded there, and the SDK warns when it connects
    # to one with this option on. Read once when the session starts. Not a
