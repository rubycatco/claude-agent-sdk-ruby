module ClaudeAgentSDK
  # Downloads a pinned Claude Code CLI binary into a project-local directory.
  #
  # Motivation: the SDK shells out to `claude`, so a deploy artifact is only
  # hermetic if the CLI version is pinned alongside it. Vendoring the ~280MB
  # binary into the gem is a non-starter, so instead a Docker build / bin/setup
  # step calls +install+, and SubprocessCLITransport#find_cli prefers that
  # vendored copy over whatever is on PATH.
  #
  # Mirrors what https://claude.ai/install.sh does: resolve a dist-tag to a
  # concrete version, read the release manifest for the platform's SHA-256,
  # stream the binary down, verify it, then move it into place atomically.
  #
  # Stdlib only (net/http, json, digest, fileutils, rbconfig) — the gem gains
  # no runtime dependency for this.
  #
  # @example Install the gem's tested version in bin/setup or a Dockerfile build step
  #   ClaudeAgentSDK::CLIInstaller.install_pinned
  # @example Pin a version of your own
  #   ClaudeAgentSDK::CLIInstaller.install(version: '2.1.220')

      #     working, and nothing is left behind but the (removed) temp file.
      #   * rename failure or a crash right before it → the old binary is
      #     still intact and runnable; the metadata already names the new
      #     version, whose checksum the old binary cannot match, so the next
      #     install sees "not installed" and redoes it cleanly.
